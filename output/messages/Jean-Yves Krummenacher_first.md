Hi Jean-Yves,

I’ve been following your work in the Singapore F&B distribution space and was impressed by your expertise in bringing quality products to the local market. Given the current surge in K-food popularity across Singapore's bar and cafe scenes, I wanted to reach out.

I’m Jiwoo from Korea, and we are introducing a unique retro snack that’s gaining significant traction: the **Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)**. 

What makes this particularly interesting for the Singapore market is its incredible versatility—it’s not just a snack, but a cost-effective pairing for cocktails, coffee, and even local favorites like Kaya jam. It offers a perfect balance of "K-food trend" appeal and high-margin potential for F&B channels like bars, hotels, and cafes looking for premium yet affordable side snacks.

I’d love to share how this "K-Retro" concept could complement your current distribution portfolio. Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this aligns with your upcoming sourcing goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
