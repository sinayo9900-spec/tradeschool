Hi John,

I've been following your work in the Singapore F&B distribution space and was impressed by how the market is evolving with more diverse and premium snack offerings.

Given the massive surge in K-food popularity and the thriving cocktail/bar scene in Singapore, I’m reaching out to introduce a unique "K-Retro" snack concept that’s currently trending. Our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) are gaining traction as an ideal, cost-effective bar snack—offering a perfect balance of nostalgic storytelling and versatile pairing with everything from craft beers to local coffee.

As an export specialist with ISO-certified production, we ensure premium quality that aligns with Singapore’s high standards. I believe this could be a great value-add to your current distribution portfolio, especially for clients looking for a "K-culture" hook with high margins.

If you're open to it, I'd love to share a brief concept deck on how this is being paired in other F&B channels. Would you be interested in a quick look?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
