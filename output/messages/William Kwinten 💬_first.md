Hi William,

I’ve been following your work in bridging Asian food products with the European market and was impressed by your expertise in identifying unique culinary trends that resonate across borders.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and I’m reaching out because we are currently seeing a significant surge in interest for "K-Retro" snacks within the global F&B sector. We have a Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) that is gaining traction as a premium yet highly cost-effective snack for bars, cafes, and hotels.

Given your mission to bring authentic Asian flavors to Europe, I believe our K-Biscuit—with its versatile pairing potential (ideal for cocktails or coffee) and its unique storytelling as a classic Korean staple—could be a compelling and scalable addition to your portfolio.

I’d love to share more about the concept and its success in Asian F&B hubs to see if it might fit your current projects. Are you open to a brief chat about this?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
