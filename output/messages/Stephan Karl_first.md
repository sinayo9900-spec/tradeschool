Hi Stephan,

Congratulations on Andaz Singapore’s recent nomination for the Travel + Leisure Luxury Awards 2026! I truly admire your "Rooted locally. Recognised globally" philosophy and the way Andaz creates meaningful, local experiences through a unique lens.

Given your focus on design-led hospitality and exceptional F&B moments—especially at your iconic rooftop venues—I wanted to reach out regarding a unique addition that aligns with the growing K-food trend in Singapore.

We specialize in premium Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits). These are a celebrated retro snack in Korea, offering a sophisticated yet nostalgic crunch that pairs exceptionally well with artisanal cocktails and specialty coffee. They provide a cost-effective, high-quality "K-retro" storytelling element that could complement the "meaningful, local experiences" Andaz is known for, perhaps as a unique bar snack or a curated welcome treat.

I’d love to share how these might add a playful yet premium touch to your F&B lineup. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
