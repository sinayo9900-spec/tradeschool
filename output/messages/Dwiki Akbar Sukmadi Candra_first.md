Hi Dwiki, 

Congratulations on your new role as Senior Brand Manager at Mondelēz International! It’s an exciting transition, and I’ve been following your impressive work leading the TARO Snack brand with great interest.

Given your deep expertise in the snacking industry and Mondelēz's footprint in the global market, I wanted to briefly introduce a product that is currently capturing the "K-food" wave in Singapore—our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits). 

These retro-inspired snacks offer a unique value proposition: they are highly cost-effective and incredibly versatile, making them perfect for the growing trend of pairing snacks with coffee, cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam. As the demand for authentic yet accessible K-snacks rises among Singaporean youth, I believe there's a significant opportunity to fill a gap in the premium-yet-affordable F&B segment.

I’d love to share how we are positioning these "K-retro" snacks for the Singaporean market if this aligns with your current strategic interests at Mondelēz.

Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you've settled into your new role?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin"""
