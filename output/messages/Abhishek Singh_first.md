Hi Abhishek,

I recently saw your post about the successful team engagement in Jaipur. It’s inspiring to see Jaguar Resources’ commitment to strengthening client relationships and reflecting on strategic progress through such meaningful gatherings.

Given your leadership in Global Procurement and the rapidly evolving F&B landscape in Singapore, I wanted to reach out regarding a strategic product opportunity. We specialize in authentic Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a versatile, cost-effective retro snack that is currently seeing high demand in the Singaporean bar and cafe scene.

As K-food trends continue to dominate the local market, these biscuits offer a unique pairing option for beverages that balances traditional charm with excellent margin potential for F&B operators. I believe this could be a valuable addition to your procurement portfolio to enhance client offerings.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some more information on how this fits the current K-snack trajectory in Singapore?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
