Hi Anaïs,

I came across your recent post about the Gira Asian Meat Club in Kuala Lumpur. It sounded like a fantastic gathering, and I particularly noted your mention of the informal discussions over a glass of wine—often where the most interesting industry insights surface!

I'm Jiwoo Shin, and I am currently introducing a unique Korean retro snack (K-Biscuit) to the Singapore F&B market. Given your focus on "a healthier world" and your deep expertise in the Asian food sector, I thought this might pique your interest.

Our K-Biscuits are gaining traction as a highly cost-effective yet trendy pairing for bars and cafes. They offer a unique "retro-cool" storytelling element that aligns perfectly with the growing K-food trend in Singapore, making them an excellent accompaniment to wine and cocktails.

I’d love to share a bit more about how these could complement the local F&B landscape you're navigating. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some more information?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
