Hi Shubhang,

I’ve been following your work in Singapore’s F&B distribution space and have noticed the impressive growth and diversification you’ve been leading within the local market.

With the K-food trend continuing to surge in Singapore, I wanted to introduce a unique, cost-effective addition to your distribution portfolio: our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). 

As a versatile retro snack, it’s proving to be an excellent pairing for Singapore’s vibrant bar and cafe scene—whether it's served alongside cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam. It offers a great balance of high-volume affordability and the trendy "K-culture" appeal that Singapore’s younger demographic is currently seeking.

I believe this could be a strategic addition to your current F&B distribution lines. If you're open to it, I'd love to send over a brief product overview or discuss how we can support your upcoming sourcing needs.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
