Hi Md.Masudul,

I've been following the recent shifts in Singapore’s F&B distribution landscape, particularly the growing demand for versatile, high-quality snacks that bridge the gap between traditional comfort and modern trends.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a premium **Korean Retro Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** that has been gaining significant traction in F&B channels. Given your expertise in distribution, I thought this might be a timely addition to your portfolio, especially for clients in the bar, cafe, and hotel sectors looking for cost-effective yet "on-trend" side snacks.

Our K-Biscuits offer:
*   **Strong K-Food Appeal**: Leverages the current popularity of Korean culture in Singapore.
*   **Exceptional Versatility**: Perfect for pairing with coffee, cocktails (as a base bar snack), or even local favorites like Kaya jam.
*   **Scalability**: Optimized for high-volume supply with premium quality standards (ISO certified).

I’d love to share more about how this simple yet effective snack can complement your current lineup and enhance value for your F&B partners.

Would you be open to a brief exchange of information to see if there’s a fit?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
