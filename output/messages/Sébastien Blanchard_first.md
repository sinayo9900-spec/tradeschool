Hi Sébastien,

I’ve been following your work in the Singapore F&B distribution space and noticed your focus on curating diverse and high-quality food products for the local market.

Given the incredible momentum K-food is seeing in Singapore right now, I wanted to introduce you to our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). It’s a classic retro snack that we’ve modernized for premium F&B channels—it works exceptionally well as a complimentary bar snack for cocktails or as a unique pairing for specialty coffee.

We specialize in export-grade production with strict quality standards, ensuring a product that is both cost-effective for high-volume distribution and appealing to the growing demographic of K-culture enthusiasts in Singapore.

I’d love to see if this could be a strategic fit for your current distribution portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some digital samples to review?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
