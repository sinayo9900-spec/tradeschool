Hi Moushmi, 

I’ve been following the impressive growth of Singapore’s F&B sector, especially the increasing consumer demand for authentic and versatile K-food experiences.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in supplying a Korean retro snack (**K-Biscuit**) that is gaining popularity as a cost-effective, premium-feel pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels. Given your role in F&B distribution, I believe our product could offer a unique competitive edge for your portfolio. Our K-Biscuits are manufactured with **export-standard quality** and offer a "retro-chic" branding that resonates with the younger demographic, serving as a perfect side for coffee, cocktails, or local pairings like Kaya jam.

I’d love to share more about how our supply structure can support your current distribution channels. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a concept deck to see if this aligns with your goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
