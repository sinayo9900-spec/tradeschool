Hi Aarif,

I’ve been following your focus on strategic sourcing and cost reduction, particularly your commitment to sustainability and risk management within the supply chain.

With the current K-food trend rapidly growing in Singapore’s F&B sector, I wanted to introduce a product that perfectly aligns with both consumer demand and cost-optimization goals: our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit).

It is a highly cost-effective and versatile snack, ideal for bars, cafes, and hotels looking to enhance their F&B offerings with a trendy, retro-inspired Korean element. Furthermore, we offer a premium line developed with plant-based ingredients, which I believe aligns well with your interests in CSR and sustainable sourcing.

I’d love to share how we are helping F&B partners optimize their snack sourcing while tapping into the K-culture wave. Would you be open to receiving a brief product overview?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
