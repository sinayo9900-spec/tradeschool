Hi Thanawan, congratulations on your new role as Food and Beverage Manager at Pullman Singapore Hill Street! It’s an exciting time to be leading the F&B strategy for such a vibrant and modern property.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and I’ve been closely following the evolving F&B trends in Singapore, particularly the growing demand for authentic K-food experiences in premium hospitality settings. I’m reaching out because I believe our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) could be a unique addition to Pullman’s lounge or bar menus.

As a high-quality, cost-effective retro snack, our K-Biscuits offer excellent pairing versatility—whether served alongside specialty coffee or as a distinctive side for craft cocktails. It’s a great way to tap into the current K-food trend while maintaining the premium standards your guests expect.

I’d love to share some insights on how these have been successfully integrated into F&B channels to enhance guest experience. Would you be open to a brief chat once you’ve settled into your new position?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
