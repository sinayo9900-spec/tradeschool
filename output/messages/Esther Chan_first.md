Hi Esther, 

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of Singapore's F&B distribution scene and noticed your impressive work in the sector.

With the continuous rise of K-food trends among Singaporean consumers, I thought our "K-Biscuit" (Korean Hardtack) might be a strategic addition to your distribution portfolio. It's a versatile, highly cost-effective snack that’s gaining traction as a premium bar and cafe accompaniment. Its unique retro appeal pairs exceptionally well with everything from craft cocktails to local favorites like Kaya jam.

We focus on high-volume supply with reliable quality standards, and I believe it could offer a fresh competitive edge to the channels you manage. 

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this fits your current lineup?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
