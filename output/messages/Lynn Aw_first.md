Hi Lynn,

I came across your recent post about the SMU MSc in Wealth Management recruitment and the heartwarming CNY reunion dinner. Your mention of a "walk down memory lane" over the past two decades really resonated with me—it's clear how much SMU values heritage and community.

I’m reaching out because I believe our "Korean Retro Snack" (Hardtack Biscuits) could add a unique touch to that welcoming atmosphere you cultivate at SMU. As K-food trends continue to grow in Singapore, these nostalgic biscuits have become a popular, versatile snack that pairs perfectly with coffee during networking sessions or as a light refreshment in student lounges. 

Given your focus on creating a premium yet warm experience for the MWM cohort and alumni, I thought this "Retro K-snack" concept might be a refreshing addition to your upcoming campus events or hospitality offerings.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how we might bring a taste of Korean heritage to SMU's vibrant community?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
