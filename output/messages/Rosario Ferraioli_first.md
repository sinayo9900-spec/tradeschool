Hi Rosario,

I really appreciated your recent post about the impact of workplace culture and the importance of how people are treated—it’s a vital perspective that often gets overlooked in the fast-paced world of operations.

I’m reaching out because I’m currently helping operations leaders in Singapore enhance their F&B guest experience with a unique "comfort" element: the **Korean Retro Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**. Given your role at Singapore PR 🇸🇬, I thought you might be interested in a snack that combines exceptional cost-efficiency with the massive "K-food" trend currently sweeping the region.

Our biscuits are perfect for high-traffic venues, offering a versatile pairing for cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam. We ensure professional, export-ready standards and premium quality to ensure they fit seamlessly into the portfolios of established Singaporean brands.

I’d love to share how we’re supporting local F&B groups with this trendy yet affordable snack. Would you be open to a brief chat?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
