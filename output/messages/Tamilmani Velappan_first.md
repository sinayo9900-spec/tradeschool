Hi Tamilmani,

I’ve been closely following the dynamic F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your impressive work in the industry. Given the current surge in K-food popularity among Singaporean consumers, I wanted to reach out.

I’m currently introducing a unique product that's gaining significant traction: **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**. 

What makes these particularly interesting for the Singapore market is their incredible versatility as a high-margin side snack for bars, cafes, and hotels. They offer a perfect blend of "retro charm" and cost-effectiveness, making them an ideal pairing for coffee or cocktails.

I believe this could be a strategic addition to your distribution portfolio to capture the growing demand for authentic yet affordable Korean snacks.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving a short product overview to see if this aligns with your current focus?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
