Hi Augustine,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of Singapore’s F&B scene, particularly how bars and cafes are creatively blending local flavors with international trends. Your expertise in the industry is truly impressive.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a unique Korean retro snack, **K-Biscuit (Korean Hardtack)**, to the Singapore market. It’s currently gaining traction as a highly cost-effective and versatile pairing for craft beers, cocktails, and even specialty coffee. 

Given the soaring interest in K-food trends among younger Singaporeans, I believe this could be a refreshing addition to your current snack lineup—whether served as a complimentary bar bite or a creative side with Kaya jam.

I’d love to share a brief deck or some pairing ideas if this sounds like something that could add value to your offerings. Would you be open to a quick chat?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
