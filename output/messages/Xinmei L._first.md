Hi Xinmei,

I noticed your background spanning both Seoul National University and NUS—it’s an impressive bridge between the Korean and Singaporean business landscapes.

Given your expertise in sourcing and product development, I wanted to reach out regarding a trend we're seeing in Singapore's F&B sector. We are introducing a classic Korean retro snack, "Korean Hardtack" (K-Biscuit), specifically curated for high-traffic F&B channels like bars and cafes.

It’s a highly cost-effective, export-ready snack that taps into the current K-food wave. We've seen great potential in pairing it with coffee or cocktails, and even localizing it with Kaya jam—offering a unique, high-margin addition for F&B portfolios.

I’d love to share more about our premium lineup if this aligns with your current focus in product development.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
