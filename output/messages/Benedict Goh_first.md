Hi Benedict,

I've been closely following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B sector, particularly the creative ways local distributors are integrating K-food trends into the nightlife and cafe scenes. Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I wanted to reach out and share a unique product that's gaining significant traction.

We specialize in export-quality Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits). While they carry a nostalgic "retro" charm from Korea, they are currently being rediscovered as a highly cost-effective, premium-quality pairing for craft beers, cocktails, and specialty coffees. 

With the current K-trend in Singapore, these biscuits offer an excellent opportunity to enhance your clients' snack lineups with something that is both versatile and budget-friendly. We focus on high-volume supply with rigorous quality standards, ensuring a reliable edge for distribution partners.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this could be a strategic fit for your current distribution channels?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
