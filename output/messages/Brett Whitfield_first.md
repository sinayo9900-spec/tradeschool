Hi Brett, 

I've been following your work in Singapore's F&B distribution and noticed your focus on bringing quality products to the local market.

With K-food trends continuing to surge in Singapore, I’m reaching out to introduce our Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit). It’s a premium quality, cost-effective snack that has become a popular staple for bars and cafes. As an export specialist, we provide ISO-certified products that offer great versatility—perfect for pairing with cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam.

I thought this might complement your existing lineup well. If you're interested, I'd love to share more about our bulk supply capabilities and how we can add value to your portfolio.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
