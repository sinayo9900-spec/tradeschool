Hi Mohana,

I hope you’re having a productive week. Given your expertise in F&B distribution in Singapore, I've been following the impressive growth of the local cafe and cocktail bar scene with great interest.

With the rising demand for unique K-food experiences, I wanted to introduce a high-value item that could perfectly complement your distribution portfolio: our Premium Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit). 

It’s a classic retro snack that has been gaining new life as a versatile pairing for coffee and cocktails. We’ve seen great success positioning it as a cost-effective, high-quality bar snack or a trendy side for cafes (especially when paired with local favorites like Kaya jam). 

As an export-specialized supplier with ISO certification, we prioritize consistent quality and scalability for our distribution partners. I’d love to share our product catalog and discuss how this could add value to your F&B client network.

Would you be open to a brief introduction?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
