Hi Mr. Shirsat,

I’ve been following your work in international business operations and noticed your extensive expertise in navigating the export-import landscape.

Given the current surge of K-food trends across Singapore’s F&B sector, I wanted to reach out regarding a product that is seeing great traction: the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit).

As a classic retro snack, it’s proving to be an exceptionally versatile and cost-effective solution for bars and cafes. It pairs uniquely well with craft cocktails and coffee, and even complements local favorites like Kaya jam, making it an ideal "K-experience" item for the Singaporean market.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this could be a strategic addition to your current import portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
