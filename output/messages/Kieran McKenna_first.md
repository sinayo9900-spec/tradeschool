# Outreach Message

Hi Kieran,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your active presence in the industry.

With the K-food trend continuing to gain significant momentum across Singapore’s F&B scene, I wanted to reach out regarding a product that bridges that trend with high operational value. We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a premium yet highly cost-effective retro snack. 

It’s specifically designed for high-volume F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels. Its versatility—pairing perfectly with cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam—makes it an ideal "blank canvas" snack for creative menus while keeping procurement costs low and margins healthy.

Given your expertise in distribution, I thought this could be a strategic addition to your current portfolio or client offerings that aligns with current consumer interests.

Would you be open to a quick exchange to see if this aligns with your current focus?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
