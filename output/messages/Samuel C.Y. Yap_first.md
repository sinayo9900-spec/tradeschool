Hi Samuel,

I’ve been following Qoo10’s impressive growth in Singapore’s e-commerce sector, particularly how the platform has successfully introduced and scaled the latest K-food trends to local consumers.

I’m reaching out because our **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** aligns perfectly with the current "K-retro" snack craze. It is a highly versatile, export-specialized product that offers excellent value—whether served as a standalone treat or paired with coffee and local favorites like Kaya jam.

As a premium quality supplier, we ensure our products meet high standards to satisfy the discerning tastes of the Singaporean market. I believe this cost-effective yet high-demand item could be a great addition to Qoo10’s snack portfolio, appealing to both nostalgic fans and younger foodies looking for the next "K-food hack."

Would you be open to a brief conversation or receiving some samples to see how this fits into your sales strategy?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
