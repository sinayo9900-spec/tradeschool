Hi Prashant,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your extensive experience in the sector.

With the current K-food trend gaining significant momentum across Singapore's younger demographic, I wanted to introduce a unique item that bridges retro charm with modern versatility: the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**. 

It is currently being positioned as a highly cost-effective, premium-quality snack ideal for B2B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels. Its unique texture makes it a perfect pairing for coffee and cocktails, or even for creative local adaptations like Kaya jam pairings—a "K-food hack" that's seeing great engagement on social media.

Given your role in F&B distribution, I believe this could be a high-margin addition to your current lineup that leverages the "K-premium" image.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving a digital brochure to see if this aligns with your distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
