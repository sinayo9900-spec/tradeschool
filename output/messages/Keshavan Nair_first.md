Hi Keshavan,

I noticed your recent post about speaking at the Singapore Business Show regarding the Employment Outlook—an incredibly relevant topic for the F&B industry right now.

I’m reaching out because Carlton Hotel has a fantastic reputation for its curated F&B experiences. Given the surging K-food trend in Singapore, I thought our Korean Retro Hardtack (K-Biscuit) could be a unique addition to your bar or lounge offerings. It’s a premium-quality, cost-effective snack that pairs excellently with cocktails and coffee, offering a "K-retro" charm that guests find both nostalgic and trendy.

I’d love to see if this could complement your current snack lineup and add value to your guest experience. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some samples?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
