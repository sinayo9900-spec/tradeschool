Hi Romain,

I saw your recent post about Tramés celebrating the next phase with Danone AMEA—congratulations on the successful engagement and the deployment of the single window for PO Management! It’s impressive to see how you’re streamlining shipment visibility and collaboration across the supply chain.

Given your focus on global sales and logistics solutions, I wanted to reach out as we are introducing a high-demand Korean retro snack to the Singaporean market: the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**. 

With the explosive growth of K-food trends in Singapore, our product offers a unique, cost-effective opportunity for F&B channels (Bars, Cafes, and Hotels). Since we prioritize supply chain reliability and hold export-ready certifications (ISO), I believe our "K-Biscuit" could be a seamless and high-margin addition to the F&B distribution networks you may be involved with.

I’d love to share more about how our streamlined supply process and premium quality can complement your current business landscape. Would you be open to a brief chat when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
