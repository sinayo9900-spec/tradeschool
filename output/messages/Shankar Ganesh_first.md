Hi Shankar,

I’ve been closely following the dynamic F&B landscape in Singapore and noticed your expertise in the industry. 

With the current K-food trend continuing to gain massive traction among Singaporean consumers, I wanted to introduce a unique item that bridges retro charm with modern F&B needs: **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**.

These biscuits are becoming a popular, cost-effective choice for premium bars and cafes looking for the perfect pairing with coffee, cocktails, or craft beers. They offer a unique storytelling element through their "Korean Retro" appeal and are highly versatile for localized recipes like Kaya jam pairings or specialty bar snacks.

Given your role in the sector, I thought this might be a timely addition to complement your current offerings or F&B strategy. 

Would you be open to a brief chat to explore if this fits your upcoming plans?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
