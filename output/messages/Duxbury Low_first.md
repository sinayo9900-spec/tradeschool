Hi Duxbury,

I've been following the innovative F&B initiatives at Novotel Clarke Quay and appreciate your focus on delivering unique guest experiences in Singapore's vibrant dining scene.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing "K-Biscuit"—a premium Korean retro snack—specifically curated for the professional F&B sector. With the current K-food trend, I believe this export-specialized, high-quality snack could be a perfect, cost-effective addition to your lounge or bar pairings, perhaps as a unique side for cocktails or coffee.

It offers a great balance of traditional storytelling and modern versatility. I’d love to share how this could complement your current menu and enhance the guest experience at your outlets.

Would you be open to a brief chat or seeing some further details?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
