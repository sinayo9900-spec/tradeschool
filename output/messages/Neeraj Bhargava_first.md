Hi Neeraj,

I’ve been following your insights on international supply chain management and procurement. Your extensive background with global leaders like J&J and P&G, combined with your active interest as an environmentalist, is truly impressive and aligns with the values we prioritize in our export operations.

Given your expertise in bridging global markets and the current K-food surge in Singapore, I wanted to reach out regarding a high-demand F&B solution: Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits). They are rapidly gaining traction as a cost-effective, versatile staple for bars and cafes—perfect for pairing with the growing cocktail and specialty coffee scene.

We are particularly proud of our premium line developed with plant-based ingredients and whole grains, catering to the increasing demand for sustainable and clean-label snack options.

I’d love to explore how this unique "retro" snack could complement your current procurement interests or distribution network. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a digital product deck?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
