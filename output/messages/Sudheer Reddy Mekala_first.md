Hi Sudheer,

I’ve been following your work in Agri-Commodity Research, and your expertise in supply-demand analytics across the agri-value chain is truly impressive.

I’m currently leading a project to introduce a high-demand Korean retro snack—Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)—to the Singapore F&B market. Given your deep understanding of agri-business consulting and market trends, I thought our initiative might align with your interests in customized agri-projects and value chain optimization.

Our product leverages the current K-food trend in Singapore while offering exceptional cost-competitiveness for bulk supply to bars, cafes, and hotels. We are focusing on a resilient supply chain model that adapts to the growing demand for premium yet affordable snacks.

I’d love to share more about our market entry strategy and how we’re positioning this product within the local F&B ecosystem. Would you be open to a brief exchange to discuss the potential you see in this category?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
