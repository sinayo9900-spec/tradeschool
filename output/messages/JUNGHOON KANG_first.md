Hi Junghoon,

I recently saw your post about the handmade origami paper plane—it was a great reminder of how simple, classic things can still hold so much charm and value today.

As you lead Marketing and Global Business, I thought you might appreciate a similar 'classic-meets-modern' concept we're bringing to Singapore. We are introducing Korean Retro Hardtack (K-Biscuit) as a versatile, cost-effective snack solution for the local F&B sector.

With the current K-food wave in Singapore, we’ve seen great potential for this biscuit to be used as a unique, high-margin pairing for craft beers and coffee, or even integrated into creative local recipes like Kaya-pairing snacks.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a concept deck on how this retro K-snack could complement your current NPD or global expansion goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
