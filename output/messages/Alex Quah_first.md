Hi Alex,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B and cocktail scene recently. With the increasing local interest in authentic K-food experiences and premium bar pairings, I wanted to reach out.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in providing high-quality Korean retro snacks—specifically our K-Biscuit (Korean Hardtack). It is currently gaining significant traction as a versatile, cost-effective pairing for bars and cafes, offering a unique "retro-cool" vibe that resonates exceptionally well with the younger demographic.

Given your expertise in the industry, I believe our export-ready products, known for their premium quality and cultural storytelling, could be a valuable and competitive addition to your current lineup.

Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps receiving some samples to see how this might fit your portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
