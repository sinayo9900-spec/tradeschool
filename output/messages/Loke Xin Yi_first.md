Hi Xin Yi,

Huge congratulations on LaCimbali being named Europe’s Best Coffee Equipment Manufacturer! As a former Barista Champion, I know you have a keen eye for everything that elevates the coffee experience.

I’m reaching out because we’re seeing a growing trend in Singapore for K-food pairings. We’ve introduced a Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit) that’s gaining traction in F&B channels for its versatility—it pairs exceptionally well with specialty coffee and fits the modern "retro" aesthetic perfectly.

I thought this could be a unique, cost-effective way to enhance the menu offerings for your partners or coffee programs. Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with any of your current projects?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
