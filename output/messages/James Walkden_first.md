Hi James,

I caught your recent post about the 2026 Wellness Journey at The Westin Singapore—the floating soundbath at your 35th-floor infinity pool looked like a truly serene and world-class experience for your guests.

I’m reaching out because I’ve been following Marriott’s leadership in elevating Singapore’s hospitality F&B standards. We are currently introducing a unique "Korean Retro K-Biscuit" to premium channels, and given the massive K-food trend in Singapore, it has been performing exceptionally well as a versatile pairing for craft cocktails and lounge services.

Our premium "Healthy Line" (oat and whole wheat versions) aligns perfectly with the wellness focus you champion at Westin, offering a sophisticated, high-quality snack option that provides a modern twist on a nostalgic classic.

I’d love to share how this could complement your current F&B lineup or guest amenities. Would you be open to receiving a brief overview of our collection?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
