Hi Shailesh,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your extensive expertise in the sector. With the current surge in K-food popularity across the region, I thought you might find our latest project particularly interesting.

We are introducing a premium line of Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) specifically designed for the F&B channel. As a professional retro snack with a modern twist, it’s gaining significant traction as a high-margin, versatile side for bars, cafes, and hotels. 

Given your focus on F&B distribution, I believe this could be a highly competitive addition to your current portfolio, especially for clients looking to capitalize on the K-culture trend with a cost-effective, premium-quality product (ISO certified).

I’d love to share a brief product deck with you if you're open to exploring new snack options for the Singapore market.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
