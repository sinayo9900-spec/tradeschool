Hi Tajgir,

I’ve been following the dynamic evolution of Singapore’s F&B landscape lately, particularly the impressive growth in the cocktail and specialty cafe sectors.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a unique Korean retro snack—the **K-Biscuit (Korean Hardtack)**—to the Singapore market. It is currently gaining attention as a highly cost-effective and versatile pairing for bars and cafes. Whether served as a complimentary bar snack or paired with coffee and Kaya jam, it offers a nostalgic storytelling element that resonates well with the current K-food trend among younger consumers.

Given your role in the industry, I thought this might be a refreshing and high-margin addition to your current snack portfolio. 

If this sounds like something that might interest you, I’d be happy to share more details or send over a product brief.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
