Hi Diwaker,

I’ve been following the vibrant F&B scene in Singapore and noticed the growing interest in unique K-food experiences and the retro snack trend.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in a versatile Korean retro snack—the K-Biscuit (Hardtack). It’s currently gaining traction as a premium yet highly cost-effective companion for bars, cafes, and hotels looking to enhance their side-snack offerings.

With the rising popularity of K-food and the sophisticated cocktail culture in Singapore, our K-Biscuit offers a unique way to complement your current lineup. It's incredibly versatile, pairing perfectly with craft cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam, providing a nostalgic yet fresh experience for customers.

I’d love to share more about how this cost-effective, export-quality snack can add value to your F&B operations. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a quick product brief?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
