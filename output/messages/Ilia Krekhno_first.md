Hi Ilia,

I came across your profile and was impressed by your work within the F&B distribution sector in Singapore. Given your expertise in identifying market-fit products, I wanted to reach out with something that aligns perfectly with current local trends.

We are currently introducing a premium Korean retro snack—the **K-Biscuit (Korean Hardtack)**—to the Singaporean F&B market. As K-food continues to influence consumer preferences, we’ve seen great potential for this biscuit as a versatile, cost-effective side snack for bars, cafes, and hotels.

What makes it unique is its adaptability; it pairs exceptionally well with coffee and cocktails, and can even be localized with combinations like Kaya jam. It offers that "K-retro" storytelling appeal that resonates strongly with the younger, trend-conscious demographic in Singapore.

I’d love to explore how the K-Biscuit might complement your current distribution portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps receiving a few more details on our range?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
