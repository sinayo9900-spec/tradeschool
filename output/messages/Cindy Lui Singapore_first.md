Hi Cindy,

I’ve been closely following the vibrant F&B landscape in Singapore and how it continues to lead the way in adopting innovative food trends across the region.

I’m reaching out because we’ve seen a significant surge in interest for authentic "K-Retro" snacks within the Singaporean market. We specialize in a premium Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) that serves as a highly cost-effective and versatile snack for bars, cafes, and hotels. 

Beyond being a budget-friendly alternative to traditional side snacks, it offers unique localization potential—pairing exceptionally well with everything from craft cocktails to local favorites like Kaya jam. Given your expertise in the industry, I thought this could be a strategic addition to complement your current F&B portfolio while leveraging the ongoing K-food wave.

Would you be open to a brief look at our product concept and how it might fit your requirements?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
