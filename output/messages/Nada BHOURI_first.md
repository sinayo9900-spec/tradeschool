Hi Nada,

I’ve been following the latest F&B trends in Singapore and noticed your impressive work within the industry. Given the growing interest in unique, high-quality snacks that complement the local cocktail and cafe culture, I wanted to reach out.

We are currently introducing a premium **Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit)** to the Singaporean market. It’s a versatile, cost-effective snack that has been gaining traction as a perfect pairing for bars and specialty coffee shops. Beyond its nostalgic "K-Retro" appeal, our product is manufactured under strict ISO standards, ensuring the premium quality and reliability that Singaporean partners value.

With the current K-food wave, I believe this could be a highly competitive addition to your current lineup, offering both a great story and excellent margins.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this might be a good fit for your upcoming projects?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
