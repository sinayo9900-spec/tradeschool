Hi Ankit,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B scene, especially the innovative ways local venues are elevating the customer experience through unique snack pairings.

I’m reaching out because we’re currently helping Singaporean businesses leverage the massive K-food trend with a versatile, high-margin staple: the **Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)**.

It’s a premium retro snack that’s becoming a favorite for bar snack pairings and cafe side menus due to its unique texture and cost-efficiency. As we specialize in export-quality products with a focus on premium standards, I believe this could be a seamless and profitable addition to your current product lineup or F&B operations.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this K-food element aligns with your goals for this year?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
