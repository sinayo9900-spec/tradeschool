Hi Abdullah,

I’ve been following your expertise in the RMG and brand stock sector and noticed your keen eye for identifying high-demand market products.

Given your experience with brand distribution, I wanted to reach out regarding the explosive growth of K-food trends in Singapore. We are currently introducing Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuits)—a retro snack that is becoming a high-margin staple for local bars and cafes. Its cost-effectiveness and versatility (perfectly pairing with coffee or cocktails) make it an ideal fit for the current Singaporean F&B landscape.

I believe this unique "retro-cool" branding could be a strong addition to a distribution portfolio looking to capitalize on the K-culture wave.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with your current interests?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
