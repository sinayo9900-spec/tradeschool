Hi Sundeep,

I've been following your work in international logistics and supply chain management, and I’m impressed by your expertise in navigating complex commodity trading and procurement landscapes.

Given your deep involvement in global supply chains, I wanted to reach out regarding the rapidly growing K-food trend in Singapore’s F&B sector. We are currently introducing a highly versatile, cost-effective Korean retro snack—the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)—specifically designed for large-scale supply to bars, hotels, and cafés.

As an export specialist focused on premium quality and reliable supply chains, we offer a product that provides a significant price advantage over local premium snacks while leveraging the "K-wave" storytelling that resonates so well with Singaporean consumers. Whether it's for bar snack pairing or retail distribution, our K-Biscuits are optimized for high-volume procurement and efficient logistics.

If you are looking to diversify your F&B portfolio with high-margin, trend-driven Korean products, I’d love to share our product deck or explore how our supply chain can support your procurement goals.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
