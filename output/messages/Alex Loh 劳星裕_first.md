Hi Alex,

I came across your recent post about bringing your daughter to your meeting—it was such a relatable and heartwarming story about navigating the transitions between family and professional life. I truly resonate with your Nest-to-Next™️ Framework and your mission to provide clarity and alignment in people's emotional and spiritual journeys.

I’m Jiwoo, and I’m currently introducing a unique piece of Korean heritage to Singapore that I believe aligns with the "comfort" and "connection" you value: our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). It’s a nostalgic retro snack that carries a rich storytelling element, making it more than just a treat—it’s a conversation starter that fits perfectly into the community-focused spaces and F&B environments where people gather to connect.

Given the rising K-food trend and the growing appreciation for authentic, storied products in Singapore, I thought there might be some interesting synergy between this "comfort food" and the supportive environments you build.

Would you be open to a brief chat to explore if this could bring a unique value to your network or projects?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
