Hi Romain,

I’ve been following the vibrant F&B scene in Singapore and noticed the increasing demand for unique, high-value snack pairings that resonate with the growing local interest in Korean culture.

I'm reaching out because we are introducing a classic Korean retro snack, the K-Biscuit (Hardtack), to the Singapore market. It has been gaining traction as a highly cost-effective and versatile side for bars and cafes—pairing exceptionally well with everything from craft cocktails to specialty coffee. 

Given the current K-food trend among Singapore's younger demographic, I thought this could be a refreshing and high-margin addition to your current offerings or upcoming projects.

Would you be open to a brief chat or if I sent over a short deck with some pairing concepts?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
