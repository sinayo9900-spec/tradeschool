Hi Marlon,

I’ve been following O'Briens Singapore’s presence in the local F&B scene, and I've always admired how your team maintains a consistent balance of quality and variety across your outlets.

I’m reaching out because we’ve noticed a significant surge in demand for K-food among Singaporean consumers. I’d love to introduce you to a unique "Korean Retro Snack" called the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). 

These biscuits are a highly cost-effective and versatile option for F&B managers looking to tap into the K-culture trend. They work perfectly as a premium side-snack for coffee pairings or even as a unique accompaniment to local favorites like Kaya jam. Our products are produced with export-level quality and ISO standards, ensuring the reliability you expect for O'Briens' operations.

I believe this could be a great, low-overhead addition to your snack lineup. Would you be open to a brief chat about how these might fit into your current seasonal offerings?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
