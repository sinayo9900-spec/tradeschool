Hi Johaness,

I saw your recent post about the Infrastructure Recruitment Drive at the NCS Hub. It’s impressive to see how NCS is strengthening Singapore’s healthcare ecosystem through such active talent acquisition.

Given the fast-paced environment at NCS, I thought our Korean K-Biscuits (Premium Hardtack) could be a unique, high-energy addition to your office pantry or upcoming recruitment events. As K-food trends continue to grow in Singapore, these retro-style snacks offer a professional, cost-effective, and "on-trend" solution for corporate catering.

Our products are export-ready with premium quality standards (ISO certified), ensuring they meet the high expectations of a leading organization like NCS. 

I’d love to see if these could add a unique Korean touch to your team’s environment. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some samples?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin

제시해주신 정보와 가이드라인을 바탕으로 작성한 `Johaness Chen_first.md` 파일의 내용입니다. 바이어의 최근 포스트(NCS Hub 채용 행사)와 헬스케어 배경을 고려하여, 사무실 간식 및 행사용 스낵으로서의 가치를 강조했습니다.

Hi Johaness,

I noticed your recent post about the Infrastructure Recruitment Drive at the NCS Hub—it's exciting to see NCS expanding its footprint in Singapore’s healthcare ecosystem.

Given the high-energy environment at the Hub and your team's focus on critical healthcare infrastructure, I thought our Korean K-Biscuits (Premium Hardtack) could be a unique addition to your office pantry or upcoming recruitment events. As K-food trends continue to gain traction in Singapore, these retro-style snacks offer a professional, cost-effective, and "on-trend" solution for corporate environments.

Our products are export-ready with premium quality standards (ISO certified), ensuring they meet the expectations of leading organizations like NCS. We even have a healthy whole-wheat line that aligns well with a healthcare-focused professional setting.

I’d love to see if these could add a unique Korean touch to the NCS Hub experience. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some samples for your team?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
