Hi Simone,

I've been following the evolving F&B landscape in Dubai and noticed your impressive work in distribution.

With the rising global interest in K-food, I wanted to introduce a unique Korean retro snack that’s gaining significant traction. Our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) offer a cost-effective, versatile solution perfect for bar snacks, cafe pairings, or retail. They balance traditional charm with modern appeal, making them an excellent fit for diverse F&B channels looking for high-margin, trendy additions.

I’d love to share more about how this could complement your current portfolio if you're open to a brief chat.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
