Hi Vikas,

I’ve been following your expertise as a sourcing consultant and was impressed by your track record in identifying high-quality products for the market. 

While I see your primary focus is on fabric and apparel, I’m reaching out because many sourcing professionals in Singapore are currently looking to capitalize on the massive K-food trend within the lifestyle and F&B sectors. We specialize in **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuit)**—a premium, ISO-certified retro snack that is proving to be a highly cost-effective and popular pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels.

Given your background in professional sourcing, I thought you might be interested in how this trending K-snack could complement any F&B-related projects or procurement inquiries you might encounter. Our products are specifically optimized for export and large-scale F&B supply.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving our product catalog to see if this fits your current sourcing interests?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
