Hi Torsten,

I’ve been following your impressive track record of growing lifestyle brands across Asia over the last 30 years. Your expertise in transforming family businesses and navigating the Asian market is truly remarkable.

Given your focus on lifestyle and brand evolution, I wanted to reach out regarding the surging K-food trend in Singapore. We are seeing a unique opportunity where "retro" Korean snacks are being reinvented as premium pairings in modern F&B spaces—from craft cocktail bars to high-end cafes.

Our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) is a classic retro staple that offers an exceptional cost-benefit ratio for F&B operators. It’s not just a snack; it’s a storytelling piece that fits perfectly with the nostalgic yet modern aesthetic that Singapore’s younger consumers are currently gravitating toward. It pairs beautifully with coffee or cocktails, providing a versatile and high-margin addition to any F&B portfolio.

I’d love to share some insights on how this "K-Retro" movement is performing in the local market and see if it aligns with the brand portfolios you oversee.

Would you be open to a brief chat when your schedule allows?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
