Hi Suzan,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of the F&B scene in Singapore and noticed your expertise in the industry. Given the massive popularity of K-food trends among Singaporean consumers lately, I wanted to reach out with something that might perfectly complement your current snack or bar offerings.

We specialize in **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a premium yet highly cost-effective retro snack that is gaining traction as a versatile pairing for bars and cafes. Whether served as a complimentary bar snack or paired with coffee and cocktails, it taps into the "K-retro" sentiment that resonates well with the local market.

I’d love to share some insights on how these could add value to your current lineup without a heavy cost burden. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a bit more information?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
