Hi Avinash,

I came across your profile and was impressed by your extensive background in project management and supply chain within the F&B distribution sector. Given your expertise in navigating the Singaporean market, I wanted to reach out regarding the evolving K-food trends we are currently observing.

We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)**—a classic retro snack that is gaining significant traction for its versatility and exceptional cost-competitiveness. It’s an ideal fit for F&B channels looking for high-margin bar snacks or unique cafe pairings (such as the 'K-Biscuit & Kaya Jam' combination).

As a professional with a PMP background, I thought you might appreciate a product that offers both supply chain reliability and clear market scalability in the current K-culture wave.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving a product brief to see if this could be a strategic addition to your distribution portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
