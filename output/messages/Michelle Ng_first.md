Hi Michelle,

I’ve been following the dynamic shifts in Singapore’s F&B landscape, particularly how venues are balancing high-quality guest experiences with effective cost management—a challenge I’m sure is front and center for you as Head of Cost Control.

With the rising popularity of K-food across Singapore, I wanted to introduce a high-margin snack solution that fits perfectly into bar and café settings: the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit).

Our product offers a unique "retro" storytelling element and exceptional versatility—pairing beautifully with coffee, cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam—all while maintaining a highly competitive cost structure compared to traditional premium snacks. It’s an ideal way to tap into the K-food trend without inflating procurement budgets.

I’d love to share a brief overview of how we’re helping F&B channels optimize their side-snack offerings while maintaining healthy margins. Would you be open to receiving a short product deck?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
