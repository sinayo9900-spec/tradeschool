Hi Ed,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B distribution sector and noticed your extensive involvement in the local landscape. 

Given the continuous surge in K-food popularity among Singaporean consumers, I wanted to reach out regarding a high-value opportunity. I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we are introducing a unique "Korean Retro Snack" concept—the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**.

Our products are produced to premium export-grade standards (ISO certified) and are specifically designed to be a cost-effective, high-margin solution for F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels. Whether it’s used as a versatile pairing for cocktails, specialty coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam, it captures the current K-food trend with a unique storytelling element that resonates with today’s consumers.

I’d love to share how this could complement your distribution portfolio and enhance your current snack lineup. Would you be open to a brief chat or me sending over further information?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
