Hi Jae Cheon,

I’ve been observing the vibrant growth of Singapore’s F&B landscape and how K-food trends are increasingly becoming a staple in the local lifestyle.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a unique Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit) that’s gaining traction as a versatile, cost-effective pairing for bars and cafes. Its distinct texture and nostalgic appeal make it an excellent accompaniment for everything from craft cocktails to specialty coffee, aligning perfectly with the current "K-retro" trend among younger consumers.

I’d love to see if this could be a refreshing and high-margin addition to your current snack offerings. Would you be open to a quick exchange of ideas on this?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
