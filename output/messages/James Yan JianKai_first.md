Hi James,

I’ve been closely following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B sector, especially the increasing demand for unique K-food experiences across bars and cafes. Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I wanted to reach out.

We are currently introducing a premium Korean Retro Biscuit (K-Biscuit) that’s gaining significant traction as a versatile F&B solution. It’s a highly cost-effective snack designed to complement coffee, cocktails, and even local favorites like Kaya jam. As K-food continues to trend among Singapore's younger demographic, we believe this product offers a unique opportunity to enhance snack portfolios with something both nostalgic and commercially viable.

Our production adheres to export-standard quality controls (ISO certified), ensuring a reliable supply for high-volume channels. I’d love to share how this could complement your current distribution lines.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving a product brief to see if this aligns with your current focus?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
