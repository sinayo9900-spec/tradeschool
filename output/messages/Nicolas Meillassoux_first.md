Hi Nicolas,

I’ve been following Brico Dépôt’s impressive distribution scale and your leadership in driving commercial growth across various retail sectors.

With the rapid growth of the F&B segment and the "K-food" trend specifically in the Singaporean market, I wanted to introduce a high-value opportunity. We specialize in Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a retro snack that combines authentic cultural appeal with exceptional cost-efficiency for high-volume distribution.

As a premium quality product with established export expertise, our K-Biscuits are uniquely positioned to complement your existing snack lineup, particularly for the bar and cafe channels. I’d love to share how this cost-competitive item can help capture the current consumer demand for Korean food trends.

Would you be open to a brief discussion on whether this could be a strategic addition to your distribution portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
