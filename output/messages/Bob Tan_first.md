Hi Bob,

I’ve been following your impressive work in F&B Marketing and IP Development at Universal Studios Singapore, especially your focus on QSR upselling strategies and product innovation.

Given your expertise in creating engaging guest experiences, I wanted to introduce a unique snack concept that aligns perfectly with the current K-food trend in Singapore. We specialize in premium **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a retro-inspired, high-margin snack that is gaining massive traction among younger audiences.

Because of its incredible cost-efficiency and versatile pairing options (from themed cafe sides to grab-and-go kiosks), I believe it could be a strategic addition to the F&B lineup at the park or the Oceanarium to drive incremental sales. Our products are produced under strict export standards, ensuring the premium quality required for world-class destinations like yours.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this fits into your upcoming product development or upselling initiatives?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
