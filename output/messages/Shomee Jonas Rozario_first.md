Hi Shomee,

I’ve been following your impressive track record in FMCG and F&B brand marketing, especially your work with global powerhouses like Burger King and Perfetti Van Melle. Given your expertise in identifying consumer trends in the Singaporean market, I wanted to reach out regarding a unique opportunity in the K-food space.

We are currently introducing a premium **Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit)** to the Singaporean F&B scene. It’s a versatile, cost-effective hardtack biscuit that’s gaining significant traction as a trendy pairing for bars, cafes, and retail channels—leveraging the current "K-retro" wave among younger consumers.

Considering your background in managing high-profile F&B portfolios, I believe this product could offer a fresh, high-margin addition to the local snack or pairing lineup.

Would you be open to a brief chat or me sending over a quick concept deck to see if there's a potential synergy?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
