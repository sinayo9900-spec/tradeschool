Dear Dr. Aryanti,

I have been following your impressive work in internationalization and entrepreneurship with great interest. Given your extensive expertise in bridging global business partnerships and your focus on luxury and business management, I wanted to reach out regarding an emerging opportunity in the Singaporean F&B sector.

As K-food continues to influence the local lifestyle, we are introducing a premium yet cost-effective Korean retro snack (K-Biscuit) specifically tailored for professional F&B environments. Its versatility makes it an excellent pairing for Singapore's vibrant cocktail bars and specialty cafes—complementing everything from craft drinks to local favorites like Kaya jam.

With your background in fostering international partnerships, I believe you would appreciate the strategic value this "K-culture" inspired product brings to the evolving F&B landscape.

I would love to share a brief overview of how this concept is being positioned for the Singapore market. Would you be open to a short exchange of ideas when your schedule permits?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
