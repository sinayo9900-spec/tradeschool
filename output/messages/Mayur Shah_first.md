Hi Mayur,

I’ve been following your work in international business development and noticed your expertise in navigating market expansions and global trade trends.

I’m reaching out because we’ve observed a significant surge in the K-food trend within Singapore’s F&B scene, particularly in the premium bar and cafe sectors. We specialize in export-ready, premium quality Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a versatile retro snack that offers excellent price competitiveness and unique pairing potential with coffee or craft cocktails.

Given your focus on identifying strategic growth opportunities, I thought our K-Biscuit lineup might be a compelling addition for your partners looking to leverage the K-culture wave with a trendy, high-margin product.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this aligns with any of your current F&B initiatives?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
