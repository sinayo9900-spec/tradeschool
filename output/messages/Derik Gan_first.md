Hi Derik,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of the F&B scene in Singapore and noticed your expertise in the distribution sector. With the current K-food wave showing no signs of slowing down, I thought you might find our latest project interesting.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize as export-experts in bringing premium Korean snacks to the global market. We’ve recently introduced a high-quality Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit) specifically designed for F&B channels. It’s a retro-inspired, cost-effective snack that’s becoming a popular staple for bars and cafes looking for versatile pairings—whether with cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like kaya jam.

Our products are produced under strict ISO-certified quality standards to ensure they meet the expectations of premium Singaporean venues. I believe this could be a strategic, high-margin addition to your portfolio that taps into the K-snack trend.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this might fit into your current distribution lineup?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
