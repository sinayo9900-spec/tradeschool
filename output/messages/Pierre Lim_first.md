Hi Pierre,

I noticed your focus on F&B distribution in Singapore and wanted to reach out. With the vibrant K-food and cocktail scene in the city, there’s a growing appetite for authentic yet versatile snacks that complement local tastes.

We’re currently introducing a retro Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit) that’s gaining traction as a highly cost-effective pairing for coffee and bar programs. Its unique 'K-retro' charm and crunchy texture make it an ideal side snack for cafes and bars looking to enhance their guest experience without a high overhead.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some more details to see if this could be a good fit for your distribution portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
