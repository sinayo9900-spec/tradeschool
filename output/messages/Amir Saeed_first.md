Hi Amir,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of the F&B scene in Singapore, especially the increasing demand for unique K-food experiences in the distribution sector. Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I thought you might find our latest project interesting.

We are introducing a premium Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit) specifically tailored for Singapore’s bar and cafe channels. It’s a retro-inspired, highly cost-effective snack that pairs perfectly with coffee and cocktails. With the current K-trend, it’s proving to be a great way for venues to offer something nostalgic yet trendy that complements their existing beverage menus.

I’d love to share more about how this could add value to your current portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a product deck?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
