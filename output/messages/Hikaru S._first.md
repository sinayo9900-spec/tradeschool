Hi Hikaru,

I've been following Bidfood’s impressive strides in diversifying Singapore’s F&B landscape. Given your focus on business development, I thought you might be interested in a product that aligns perfectly with the current K-food surge in the local market.

We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** to Singapore. It’s a versatile, retro-themed snack that’s gaining significant traction in F&B channels—specifically bars and cafes—due to its exceptional cost-competitiveness and unique pairing potential with coffee, cocktails, and even local favorites like Kaya jam.

As an export specialist, we prioritize premium quality and reliability to meet the high standards of Singaporean procurement. I’d love to share how this "K-snack" concept could complement Bidfood’s current distribution lineup and provide your clients with a trendy, high-margin side option.

Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas on this?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
