Hi Shams,

I’ve been following your impressive track record of over 26 years in FMCG and food processing, particularly your focus on driving operational excellence and manufacturing efficiency. Your expertise in maintaining high-quality standards in large-scale production is truly remarkable.

Given your leadership in the food sector, I wanted to reach out regarding a strategic opportunity in the Singapore F&B market. We are currently introducing the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)—a classic retro snack that is seeing a surge in demand as a cost-effective, high-margin pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels.

Beyond the K-food trend, our product is designed for operational efficiency. It offers high supply stability and versatile pairing options—from cocktails to local favorites like Kaya jam—making it an ideal "plug-and-play" solution for F&B procurement. We prioritize export-grade quality and hold rigorous standards (ISO-focused) to ensure reliability for our international partners.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how this K-food staple could complement your current distribution or operational interests in Singapore?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
