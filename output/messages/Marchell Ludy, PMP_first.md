Hi Marchell, I noticed your focus on F&B distribution in Singapore and the evolving dining landscape there.

Given the strong momentum of K-food trends, I thought our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) could be a compelling addition to your portfolio. They are a cost-effective, export-grade (ISO certified) snack that pairs beautifully with coffee and cocktails, offering a unique retro charm that resonates with modern consumers.

I'd love to share how these might complement your current F&B offerings. Are you open to a brief chat?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
