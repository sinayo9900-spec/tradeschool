Hi Dale,

I really enjoyed your recent post about treating AI agents like junior employees—it’s a brilliant perspective on handling repeatable work and focusing on high-level strategy.

As you lead Secta9ine and SPC Group’s digital and F&B initiatives, I wanted to share a unique opportunity at the intersection of the K-food trend and F&B efficiency. We are currently introducing a premium **Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit)** to the Singapore market.

It is a highly cost-effective, versatile snack that pairs exceptionally well with coffee and cocktails. Given SPC's strong presence in the cafe and hospitality scene, I believe this 'K-Hardtack' could serve as a unique, high-margin side snack or a creative pairing element for your local outlets.

I’d love to share more about how this could complement your current F&B lineup if you're interested.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
