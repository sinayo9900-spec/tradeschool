Hi Yasshpal,

I’ve been following Gopal Corporation Limited’s impressive footprint in the export sector and how you've been navigating the evolving F&B market trends across the region.

Given your expertise in global exports, I wanted to reach out regarding the surging K-food momentum in Singapore. I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we are currently helping F&B partners introduce "Korean Hardtack Biscuits" (K-Biscuits)—a premium, ISO-certified retro snack that is gaining significant traction as a versatile pairing for bars, cafes, and hospitality channels.

What makes our K-Biscuits particularly relevant for your portfolio is their exceptional cost-effectiveness for high-volume supply, combined with the "retro-cool" branding that resonates with today’s consumers. Whether as a staple bar snack or a unique side for specialty coffee and cocktails, it’s a product designed to complement and elevate existing F&B lineups.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this could be a strategic fit for your current export distribution?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
