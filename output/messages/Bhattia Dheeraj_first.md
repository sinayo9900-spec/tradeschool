Hi Bhattia,

I’ve been following your impressive work with the Dorchester Collection and your contributions as a WSET Educator. Given your deep expertise in the global wine and hospitality landscape, I wanted to reach out with something unique that’s currently gaining traction in the premium F&B scene.

We are introducing a premium "Korean Hardtack" (K-Biscuit) to Singapore—a retro-inspired snack that is surprisingly versatile. Beyond its nostalgic appeal, it has become a favorite for its unique pairing potential with craft cocktails and various beverage profiles, offering a cost-effective yet culturally trendy alternative to standard bar snacks.

With the K-food wave continuing to grow in Singapore, I believe this "K-retro" element could add a refreshing touch to the guest experience at your venues.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how this unique pairing might complement your current F&B offerings?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
