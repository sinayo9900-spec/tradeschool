Hi Daryl,

Congratulations on your new journey as General Manager at NTPM Singapore! It’s always exciting to see experienced leadership taking the helm at such a prominent player in the consumer goods sector.

I’m reaching out because I believe our latest product could be a strategic fit for NTPM’s distribution network or your F&B partners in Singapore. We specialize in Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a premium, retro-themed snack that perfectly captures the current K-food trend while offering exceptional cost-efficiency for high-volume channels like bars, cafes, and hotels.

Given your role in overseeing operations, I thought you might be interested in a high-margin snack option that pairs beautifully with Singapore’s growing cocktail and coffee culture. Our products are export-ready and designed to complement existing F&B lineups seamlessly.

I'd love to share more about how this could add value to your current portfolio. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you've settled into your new role?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
