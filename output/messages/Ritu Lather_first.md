Hi Ritu,

I’ve been following your insights into the agro commodities sector and noticed your focus on identifying emerging food trends that resonate with the Southeast Asian market.

Given the incredible surge in K-food popularity across Singapore’s F&B scene, I wanted to reach out regarding a premium, export-ready Korean 'Retro' snack—the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). We’ve seen it gain significant traction as a highly cost-effective and versatile pairing for bars, cafes, and hospitality channels.

As an Agro Commodities Trader, I thought you might find the product’s strong price competitiveness and its ability to complement existing snack portfolios particularly interesting for the Singaporean market.

Would you be open to a brief look at our product concept and how it aligns with current K-food trends?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
