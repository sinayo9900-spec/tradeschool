Hi Rakesh,

I’ve been following Agri Exports’ impressive footprint in the food and agricultural distribution sector and wanted to reach out. Given your role as Business Head, I thought you might find interest in a specific K-food trend that is currently showing great potential in the Singaporean F&B market.

We are introducing a premium Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit / Hardtack) specifically positioned for the growing bar and cafe culture. With the strong demand for K-food in Singapore, these biscuits serve as a highly cost-effective and versatile pairing for cocktails and coffee—offering a unique "retro-cool" experience that appeals to the younger demographic.

Our products are produced with export-grade quality standards (including Halal-certified options for specific lines) and are designed to complement existing F&B line-ups with minimal overhead.

I’d love to explore whether this could be a strategic addition to Agri Exports’ portfolio or your distribution network. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas or receiving a product brief?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
