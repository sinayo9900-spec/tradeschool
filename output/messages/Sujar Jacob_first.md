Hi Sujar,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B distribution sector and noticed your focus on bringing diverse food solutions to the market. Given the surging popularity of K-food and the increasing demand for unique, cost-effective bar and cafe snacks in Singapore, I wanted to reach out.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in a modern take on a classic Korean favorite—the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). It’s a retro-inspired snack that offers exceptional price competitiveness, making it an ideal choice for bars, cafes, and hospitality venues looking for a high-quality yet economical side snack.

What makes it stand out is its versatility; it pairs beautifully with everything from specialty coffee to craft cocktails, and even local favorites like Kaya jam. It’s a simple way to tap into the K-food trend while maintaining strong margins.

I’d love to see if this could be a valuable addition to your current distribution portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps seeing some product details?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
