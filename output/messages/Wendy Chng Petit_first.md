Hi Wendy,

I’ve been following your work with Les Vergers Boiron’s growth across Southeast Asia. Given your impressive background in managing premium culinary solutions and your multicultural expertise in the F&B sector, I thought you might find our latest project particularly relevant.

We are currently bridging the gap between the booming K-food trend and Singapore's sophisticated bar and cafe scene with our **K-Hardtack (Korean Retro Biscuit)**. As someone deeply involved in premium sales management, you’ve likely seen the shift toward unique, nostalgic snack pairings. Our product offers a high-value, export-quality alternative that complements premium cocktails and coffee perfectly—potentially adding a fresh "K-retro" edge to the snack offerings within your professional network.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether this fits the current appetite for curated F&B experiences in Singapore. Would you be open to a brief exchange when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
