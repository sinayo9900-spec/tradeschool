Hi Sagar,

Congratulations on your new role as Food and Beverage Manager at The First Collection! It’s an exciting move, and I’m sure your expertise will bring great things to their F&B operations.

I’m reaching out because I’ve noticed how rapidly the K-food trend is evolving in Singapore, particularly within premium F&B channels. We specialize in a classic Korean retro snack—Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuit)—which is becoming a popular, high-margin alternative for bar and cafe snack programs.

Given your new position, I thought this could be a timely addition to your menu strategy. These biscuits offer a unique "retro-cool" storytelling element and are highly versatile, pairing exceptionally well with both craft cocktails and specialty coffee.

I’d love to share how these might complement your current lineup at The First Collection. Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps receiving some samples to see if they’re a fit?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
