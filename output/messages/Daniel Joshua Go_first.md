Hi Daniel,

I came across your recent post regarding the "survival vs. protection" narrative—it was a truly profound and thought-provoking perspective on systemic resilience. It’s rare to see such meaningful commentary in a professional space, and it really resonated with the idea of demanding better standards rather than just making do.

I’m reaching out because I noticed your expertise in Sales & Marketing within the F&B landscape. Given the current K-food momentum in Singapore, I thought you might be interested in a product that bridges authentic Korean culture with practical business value.

We are introducing our export-grade Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) to the Singapore market. As a premium retro snack, they are specifically designed to complement high-traffic F&B channels like bars and cafes. They offer a unique, cost-effective pairing for cocktails or coffee, allowing venues to tap into the K-culture trend with a high-quality, reliable supply.

If you’re looking for new items to enhance your current F&B portfolio or marketing strategy, I’d love to share more about how these could fit your needs.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
