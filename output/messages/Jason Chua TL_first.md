Hi Jason, I’ve been following your work in logistics management and was impressed by your expertise in navigating the complexities of the regional supply chain.

With the current K-food trend surging in Singapore’s F&B scene, I’m reaching out because we’ve introduced a premium Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit) specifically optimized for export and high-volume channels like bars and cafes. As an export-specialized product with ISO-certified quality, it offers a unique, cost-effective alternative to traditional bar snacks that fits perfectly with the local preference for retro-themed K-snacks.

I’d love to share how our K-Biscuits are currently being paired with local favorites like coffee or cocktails to drive customer engagement. Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this could be a valuable addition to your current portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
