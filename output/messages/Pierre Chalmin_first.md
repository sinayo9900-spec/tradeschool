Hi Pierre,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your active involvement in the industry.

With the K-food trend continuing to gain significant momentum across Singapore's bar and cafe scenes, I wanted to introduce a unique item that bridges the gap between cost-efficiency and trendy consumer appeal: our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit).

As a retro-inspired snack with deep cultural roots, it offers a versatile pairing option for cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam. It’s designed specifically for high-volume F&B channels looking for a high-margin, trendy alternative to traditional bar snacks.

Given your expertise in distribution, I thought this could be a compelling addition to your portfolio to meet the growing demand for authentic yet affordable Korean flavors.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this might be a good fit for your current distribution channels?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
