Hi Marlon,

I was recently reading your post about the Lunar New Year celebrations at Pullman Singapore Hill Street. The emphasis on making guests feel at home through thoughtful details like the hand-delivered Ang Baos really reflects the "Hospitality Excellence" you mentioned—it's inspiring to see such dedication to the guest experience.

As the F&B scene in Singapore continues to embrace unique K-food trends, I've been working on introducing a classic yet premium Korean snack that fits perfectly with sophisticated hotel environments. Our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) offer a nostalgic, retro charm that pairs exceptionally well with coffee or even as a unique base for bar snacks and cocktail pairings. 

It’s a cost-effective way to add a touch of the K-culture trend to your guest experience without compromising on the high standards Pullman is known for. I’d love to share how these could complement the diverse F&B offerings at your property.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some samples to see if they fit your current lineup?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
