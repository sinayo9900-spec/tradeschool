Hi Đoan Trinh,

I’ve been following the F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your focus on the latest food trends. With the ongoing K-food momentum and the growing demand for unique bar snack pairings, I wanted to reach out regarding a potential fit for your portfolio.

We are currently helping distributors introduce a premium Korean retro snack—the **Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)**. It is a highly cost-effective and versatile option specifically designed for F&B channels like bars and cafes. Our products are export-ready with high quality standards (ISO-ready) and offer a unique storytelling element that resonates with the current interest in Korean culture.

Given your expertise in the sector, I thought this could be a great complementary item for your current lineup. Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with your focus for this year?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
