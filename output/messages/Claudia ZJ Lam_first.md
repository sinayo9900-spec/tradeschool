Hi Claudia,

I’ve been following Activate Interactive’s impressive growth in Singapore’s tech landscape and admire the vibrant company culture you’re building as a Senior TA Specialist.

Since employee experience and workplace perks are so vital for talent retention today, I wanted to introduce a unique snack option that’s currently trending—**Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**. These premium retro snacks are gaining huge popularity in Singapore as a light, nostalgic "K-food hack" that pairs perfectly with office coffee or team tea breaks.

Given the strong K-food wave among Singapore’s young professionals, I thought these would be a refreshing and cost-effective addition to your pantry or a unique gift for employee appreciation events. Our products are export-specialized with high-quality standards (ISO certified).

Would you be open to receiving a brief brochure or a sample pack for your team to try?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
