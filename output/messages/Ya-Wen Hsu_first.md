Hi Ya-Wen,

I've been closely following the dynamic F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your active involvement in the industry. 

Given the growing K-food trend and the evolving cocktail culture in Singapore, I’m reaching out to introduce our "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit). It’s a classic retro snack that has been reimagined as a premium, cost-effective pairing for bars and cafes. We’ve seen great potential in how its nostalgic appeal resonates with younger consumers looking for unique K-food experiences.

I believe this could be a versatile addition to your current distribution lineup, especially for partners looking for high-quality, export-ready snacks that offer a distinct competitive edge.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this aligns with your current focus?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
