Hi Kuanwee,

I’ve been following Panasonic’s innovative strides in Singapore’s retail and hospitality sectors and was impressed by your focus on enhancing B2B experiences.

With the current K-food trend gaining significant momentum in Singapore, I’m reaching out to introduce a high-value opportunity that aligns with this demand. We provide a premium Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit) specifically curated for F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels. It’s a cost-effective yet trendy pairing option that resonates well with the local audience's growing interest in authentic K-culture.

Our products are produced with the highest export standards and ISO certifications, ensuring the premium quality and reliability that partners in Singapore expect. I believe our K-Biscuits could be an excellent addition to the F&B or retail ecosystems you are developing.

Would you be open to a brief exchange on how this could complement your current business development initiatives?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
