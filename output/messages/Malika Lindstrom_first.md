Hi Malika,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore and noticed your impressive work in the distribution sector. 

Given the strong K-food momentum currently sweeping through Singapore, I wanted to reach out regarding a classic Korean retro snack that is gaining significant traction: Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit). It is an exceptionally cost-effective and versatile option for bar and cafe pairings—perfectly complementing coffee, cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam.

Our biscuits are produced with a focus on premium quality and export standards (ISO), offering a unique storytelling element through Korean retro culture. I believe this could be a highly competitive addition to your current distribution lineup, especially for clients looking for trendy yet budget-friendly snack solutions.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this might be a good fit for your portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
