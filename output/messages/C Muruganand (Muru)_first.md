Hi Muru,

I’ve been following the dynamic shifts in Singapore’s F&B distribution sector, particularly the growing demand for unique, high-quality snacks that cater to both the youth market and the professional hospitality scene.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and I specialize in high-quality K-food exports. I’m currently introducing our "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit) to the Singapore market. It’s a premium, retro-style snack that offers exceptional cost-efficiency, making it an ideal bar snack or cafe accompaniment. 

Given your focus on F&B distribution, I believe our product could be a strategic addition to your portfolio—especially with the current K-food trend and the versatility this biscuit offers for pairings with coffee or cocktails. Our facility is ISO-certified, and we have extensive experience in international export to ensure premium quality.

I’d love to share more about how this could complement your current distribution lines. Would you be open to a brief look at our product presentation?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
