Hi Damien,

I've been following the dynamic growth of Singapore's F&B sector and noticed your expertise in food distribution. With the rising popularity of K-food and the vibrant bar and cafe scene in Singapore, I wanted to reach out.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in a unique Korean retro snack called "K-Biscuit" (Korean Hardtack). It’s currently gaining traction as a versatile, cost-effective side snack that pairs exceptionally well with coffee and cocktails—perfect for the diverse F&B channels you manage. 

Our product offers a high-margin opportunity by blending the K-food trend with a premium, export-ready quality (ISO certified) that meets the standards of Singapore's discerning market.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how K-Biscuit could add a trendy and profitable edge to your current distribution portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
