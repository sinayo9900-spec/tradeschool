Hi Jacqueline,

I’ve been following your impressive track record in strategic sourcing and materials management, and I especially admire your role as a Diversity and Inclusion Champion. It’s rare to see such a strong bridge between procurement operations and organizational culture.

With the current K-food trend rapidly expanding in Singapore’s F&B scene, I’m reaching out because our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) might be a strategic fit for your supply planning. It is a premium, export-grade retro snack that offers exceptional cost-competitiveness, particularly for high-volume channels like bars, cafes, and hotel F&B.

Beyond its efficiency in materials management, the K-Biscuit is gaining traction for its versatility—from cocktail pairings to local Kaya jam combinations. I believe it could provide a unique, high-margin alternative to your current snack portfolio while tapping into the growing demand for authentic Korean flavors.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to share a few details on how we’re helping F&B partners scale their snack offerings with this concept.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
