Hi Wasito,

I was truly inspired by your philosophy of "Serving with Heart ❤️." In the hospitality and F&B industry, it’s often those small, thoughtful details that create the most memorable experiences for guests.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a beloved Korean classic to Singapore’s vibrant F&B scene—the **K-Biscuit (Korean Hardtack)**. As K-food trends continue to captivate Singaporean consumers, this retro snack offers a unique, high-quality, and cost-effective way to complement your service, whether as a premium bar snack or a unique side for coffee and cocktails.

Our biscuits are produced with export-grade standards, ensuring both nostalgic charm and consistent quality that aligns with the "heartfelt" service you champion. I believe it could be a distinctive addition to your current offerings, adding a touch of Korean storytelling to your guest experience.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how these K-Biscuits might fit into your vision?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
