Hi Thant, hope you're having a productive week. As a Trader in the Singapore F&B distribution space, I'm sure you've noticed the sustained momentum of K-food trends across the island.

I’m currently introducing a 'Korean Hardtack Biscuit' (K-Biscuit)—a versatile, cost-effective retro snack that's gaining traction as a unique pairing for bars, cafes, and hospitality venues. Given its high volume potential and alignment with current consumer interests in Singapore, I believe it could be a strategic addition to your distribution portfolio.

Would you be open to a quick chat or receiving some more details on how this fits the local F&B scene?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
