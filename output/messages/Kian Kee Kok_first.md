Hi Kian Kee,

I’ve been closely following the impressive growth of The Food Purveyor and how you've successfully positioned Village Grocer and B.I.G. as benchmarks for premium retail curation. Your commitment to bringing high-quality, diverse international flavors to the local market is truly inspiring.

Given the continuous surge in K-food popularity across the region, I’m reaching out to introduce our **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**. It is a classic retro snack that perfectly captures the "K-heritage" trend while offering incredible versatility—from a standalone snack to an excellent pairing for coffee or even local favorites like Kaya jam.

Beyond its cost-competitiveness, our K-Biscuit is produced with export-ready standards to ensure the premium quality your customers expect. I believe it could be a unique, high-margin addition to your current K-food lineup that resonates well with the modern consumer's search for authentic yet affordable snacks.

Would you be open to a brief introduction or receiving a product deck to see if this aligns with your sourcing goals for this year?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
