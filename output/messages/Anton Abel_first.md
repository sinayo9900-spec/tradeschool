Hi Anton,

I came across your profile and was impressed by your extensive background in supply chain solution design and finished goods management. Given your expertise in navigating complex distribution networks, I thought you might find our recent developments in the Singaporean F&B sector particularly interesting.

As the demand for K-food trends continues to surge in Singapore, we are introducing **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuit)**—a premium, export-specialized retro snack. It is designed as a highly cost-effective "Finished Good" specifically for high-volume F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels. Its versatility for pairings (coffee, cocktails, or local favorites like Kaya jam) makes it an excellent addition to any distribution portfolio looking to capitalize on the K-culture wave.

I’d love to share some insights on how we are positioning this product for the Singapore market and see if there's a potential fit for your current logistics or distribution projects. 

Would you be open to a brief chat when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
