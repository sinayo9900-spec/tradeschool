Hi Krishna,

I’ve been following your expertise in Singapore's F&B distribution sector and noticed your eye for products that align with local consumer shifts.

With the rising demand for K-food in SG, I wanted to share a versatile and cost-effective snack option: **Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)**. It’s a premium, export-quality biscuit that is perfect as a bar snack or a side for coffee and cocktails. Its high price-competitiveness and unique pairing potential (such as with Kaya jam) make it a great fit for the local F&B and hospitality channels.

Would you be open to a quick exchange to see if this could complement your current distribution portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
