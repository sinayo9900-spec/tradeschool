Hi Puneet,

I've been following the dynamic growth of the F&B distribution sector in Singapore, particularly how it's successfully integrating global food trends.

I’m reaching out because we are seeing a significant surge in interest for "K-retro" snacks within the Singaporean bar and cafe scene. We provide a premium Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) that serves as an exceptionally cost-effective, high-quality pairing for coffee and cocktails.

Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I thought this might be a timely addition to your portfolio to leverage the current K-food momentum. It's a versatile product that fits perfectly as a complimentary bar snack or a retail item for the younger demographic.

If you're open to it, I'd love to share a few more details on how we’re supporting partners in Singapore with this line.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
