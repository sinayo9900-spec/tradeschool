Hi Makhdoom,

I’ve been following your insights on strategic sourcing and cost optimization within the food manufacturing sector. Your focus on supplier performance and efficiency is particularly impressive given the current shifts in the global supply chain.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and I’m reaching out because we’ve recently introduced a premium 'Korean Retro Biscuit' (K-Biscuit) to the Singapore market that I believe aligns with your procurement priorities. 

Our product is specifically designed for high-volume F&B channels like bars and cafes, offering exceptional cost-competitiveness while tapping into the massive K-food trend. As an ISO-certified supplier, we provide an export-ready solution that allows procurement teams to optimize their snack portfolios without compromising on quality or trendy appeal.

I’d love to share a brief product overview to see if this could be a strategic fit for your upcoming sourcing goals. Would you be open to a quick exchange?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
