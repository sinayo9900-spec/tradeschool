Hi Ruhi,

I’ve been following the vibrant F&B scene in Singapore, particularly how the K-food trend is evolving beyond main courses into unique snacks and creative pairings.

I'm reaching out because we’ve seen great success introducing our **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)** as a versatile, cost-effective side for bars and cafes. They pair exceptionally well with coffee or cocktails and offer a unique "retro" storytelling element that resonates with the younger demographic. 

Given your presence in the industry, I thought this could be a high-margin addition to complement your current snack lineup. 

Would you be open to a brief chat or me sending over a product catalog to see if there’s a potential fit?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
