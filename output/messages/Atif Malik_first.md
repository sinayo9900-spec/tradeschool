Hi Atif,

I've been following the recent shifts in Singapore's F&B distribution landscape, particularly the growing demand for unique, high-value snack pairings in the bar and cafe sectors.

With the current K-food trend at an all-time high, I thought you might be interested in our **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**. It’s a classic retro snack that has been gaining massive traction as a versatile, cost-effective side for cocktails, coffee, and even local favorites like Kaya jam.

We specialize in export-ready, premium quality biscuits (ISO certified) that offer a significant price advantage for high-volume F&B channels. I believe it could be a highly competitive addition to your current distribution portfolio.

I’d love to share a few pairing concepts that are currently trending in Korea if you're open to a quick chat.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
