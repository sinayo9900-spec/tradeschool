Hi Christina,

I caught your post about Stripe’s BFCM live stats machine—it’s fascinating to see this year's transaction numbers already surpassing last year’s! With your extensive background at Amazon and Shopee, you clearly have a great perspective on how the retail and e-commerce landscape is evolving.

I’m reaching out because we are seeing a significant "K-food" momentum in the Singapore market that aligns with these growth trends. I’m Jiwoo, and we’re introducing Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) as a high-margin, retro-themed snack for retail and F&B channels. Given the surging interest in K-culture, these biscuits offer an excellent opportunity to complement existing snack portfolios with a high-conversion, cost-effective product.

I’d love to share some insights on how K-food trends are currently performing in the Singaporean retail space. Would you be open to a brief chat when you have a moment?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
