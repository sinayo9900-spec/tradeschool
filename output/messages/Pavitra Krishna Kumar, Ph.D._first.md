Dear Dr. Pavitra Krishna Kumar,

I’ve been following your contributions to the food technology sector and your interest in evolving consumer trends. Given your expertise in food innovation, I wanted to reach out and share a unique K-food concept we are currently introducing to the Singaporean market.

We are launching the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a classic retro snack that is gaining significant traction within the modern F&B landscape. While it carries a rich heritage, its clean ingredient profile and crisp texture make it an incredibly versatile base for contemporary pairings, such as artisanal coffee, craft cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam.

From a technical and quality standpoint, our production adheres to rigorous international standards (including ISO certification), ensuring the premium quality and consistency required for large-scale F&B distribution. We believe this "K-Retro" trend offers a high-value, cost-effective opportunity to enhance snack portfolios and tap into the growing local appetite for authentic Korean flavors.

I would love to learn more about your perspective on current food trends in Singapore and explore how our K-Biscuit might complement the market's needs. Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving more details?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
