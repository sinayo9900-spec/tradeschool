Hi Deneen,

Happy Lunar New Year! I really enjoyed your recent post about "galloping into the Year of the Horse" with momentum and strength. Your focus on building winning partnerships resonates deeply with how I approach business as well.

As you partner closely with leaders in the Supply Chain and Procurement space, I wanted to reach out regarding the rising K-food trend in Singapore’s F&B sector. We are currently introducing a premium Korean Retro K-Biscuit—a highly cost-effective and versatile snack that’s gaining significant traction as a unique pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels.

Given your expertise in the procurement landscape, I believe there’s a great opportunity for this product to add value to the F&B supply chains within your network, especially as businesses look for high-quality, "K-trend" alternatives.

Would you be open to a brief chat or me sending over a quick overview of how we're positioning this in the local market?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
