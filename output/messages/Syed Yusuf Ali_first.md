Hi Syed,

I’ve been following the recent shifts in Singapore’s F&B distribution landscape, particularly the impressive growth of the K-food segment across bars and cafes.

I'm reaching out because we've seen significant interest in our **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**. It’s a retro-inspired, export-spec snack that offers exceptional cost-efficiency—making it a perfect high-margin "table snack" for bars or a unique pairing for specialty coffee and cocktails.

Our products are manufactured under strict ISO standards to ensure premium quality for international markets. Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I thought this might be a timely addition to your current lineup to capitalize on the ongoing K-snack trend.

Would you be open to a quick look at our product brief to see if this aligns with your distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
