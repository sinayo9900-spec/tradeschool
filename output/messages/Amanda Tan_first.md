Hi Amanda,

Congratulations on obtaining your new certification in Strategic Procurement and Inventory Management from Aventis Learning Group! It’s impressive to see your commitment to professional growth in such a specialized field.

I’m reaching out because I’ve been following Big Sailing’s role in the Singapore F&B sector. With the massive K-food trend currently sweeping through Singapore, I believe our Korean Retro "K-Biscuits" could be a high-value addition to your procurement strategy—especially for bar and cafe supply chains.

These biscuits are exceptionally cost-effective and offer great versatility, pairing perfectly with everything from craft cocktails to local favorites like Kaya jam. Given your expertise in strategic procurement, I thought you might appreciate a product that balances trendy K-food appeal with strong margin potential.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how these might fit into your current F&B lineup?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
