Hi Shazil,

I’ve been following your impressive work in driving retail category growth and private label development. Your expertise in identifying high-potential import categories and scaling them within the Singaporean E-commerce landscape truly stands out.

Given the continuous surge of K-food popularity in Singapore, I wanted to reach out regarding a unique product that aligns perfectly with your focus on private label and import growth: the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit).

It is a versatile, cost-competitive retro snack that offers a distinct "K-experience." What makes it particularly interesting for your category is its flexibility—it can be positioned as a premium bar snack or a retail favorite when paired with local staples like Kaya jam. Our production meets high export standards (ISO certified), ensuring the premium quality and reliability that Singaporean retailers demand.

I’d love to share how this "K-Retro" concept could complement your current retail lineup and drive new category growth. 

Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas on this?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
