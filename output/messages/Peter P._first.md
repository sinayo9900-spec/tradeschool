Hi Peter,

I’ve been following your work at WPIC in taking brands into the APAC market—your expertise in navigating regional trade and consumer trends is truly impressive.

I’m reaching out because we’re currently seeing a significant surge in the 'Korean Retro' trend within the Singapore F&B scene. We’ve launched a Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) specifically tailored for premium bars and cafes as a versatile, cost-effective pairing for cocktails and coffee.

Given your focus on Special Accounts and APAC expansion, I thought this might be a unique addition to your portfolio or a high-margin item for your partners looking to capitalize on the current K-food wave.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this aligns with any of your current projects?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
