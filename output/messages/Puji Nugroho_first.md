Hi Puji,

I noticed your impressive background in international trade and pre-shipment inspection. Given your 5+ years of expertise in ensuring quality and compliance for global exports, I’m reaching out to you as someone who truly understands the importance of reliable supply chains.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we are currently preparing to expand our "Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)" into the Singapore F&B market. It’s a retro-inspired snack that's gaining significant traction as a versatile, cost-effective side for bars, cafes, and hotels—perfectly tapping into the current K-food trend.

Knowing your eye for quality and export standards, I thought you might appreciate a product that balances high-volume supply efficiency with premium manufacturing standards (ISO certified). Our goal is to provide Singaporean distributors with a snack that complements existing beverage lineups while offering a unique storytelling element.

I’d love to briefly share how we’re positioning this in the local F&B scene and see if it aligns with any of your current trade interests or networks. 

Would you be open to a quick exchange of ideas?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
