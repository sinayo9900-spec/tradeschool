Hi Richard,

I've been following the vibrant growth of the F&B scene in Singapore and noticed your focus on bringing high-quality, innovative food experiences to the market.

Given the surging interest in K-food trends among Singaporean consumers, I'm reaching out to introduce our **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**. These are premium retro snacks that offer an exceptional price-to-quality ratio, making them an ideal side snack for bars, cafes, and hotel F&B channels looking to optimize their procurement costs without compromising on quality.

Beyond being a standalone snack, they pair beautifully with coffee and craft cocktails—or even the local favorite, Kaya jam—providing a versatile and trendy addition to your current lineup. As an export-focused producer maintaining high standards (ISO certified), we’ve seen great success in tapping into the "K-retro" aesthetic that appeals strongly to the younger demographic.

Would you be open to exploring how these K-Biscuits might complement your current snack portfolio? I'd be happy to share more details if this aligns with your interests.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
