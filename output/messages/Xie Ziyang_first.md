Hi Xie Ziyang,

I’ve been closely following the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore, especially the creative ways K-food trends are being blended into the local bar and cafe culture.

I'm reaching out because I believe our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) could be a great addition to your current offerings. It’s a classic retro snack that’s gaining traction for its versatility—perfect as a complimentary bar snack or a unique pairing with coffee and cocktails. It offers that authentic K-food premium appeal while remaining highly cost-effective for high-volume supply.

If you're interested in exploring how this could add a new "K-touch" to your lineup, I'd love to share more details.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
