Hi Marco,

I’ve been following your work as a Global Category Manager and have always admired your eye for identifying products that align with evolving global food trends and consumer preferences.

Given the current surge of interest in K-food across the Singaporean F&B landscape, I wanted to reach out regarding a unique category opportunity. We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a classic retro snack that perfectly bridges the gap between high-quality K-culture storytelling and exceptional cost-efficiency.

I believe this product offers a compelling value proposition for your current portfolio:
- **Exceptional Cost-Efficiency**: Ideal for high-volume channels like bars, cafes, and hotels as a versatile side snack.
- **K-Retro Trend**: Capitalizes on the "K-Retro" movement seen in global media, making it highly marketable to the younger demographic.
- **Versatile Pairing**: It pairs beautifully with everything from specialty coffee and cocktails to local Singaporean favorites like Kaya jam.

I’d love to get your perspective on whether a cost-effective, trend-driven snack like this could be a strategic fit for your upcoming category plans. 

Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas or receiving some more detailed information?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
