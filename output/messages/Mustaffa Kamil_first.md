Hi Mustaffa,

I've been following your profile and was quite impressed by your extensive background in purchasing and food sourcing, especially as you embark on your new startup journey. Congratulations on the new venture!

I’m reaching out because we’ve seen a significant surge in the K-food trend within Singapore's F&B sector, and I believe there’s a unique opportunity for your portfolio. We specialize in **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a retro, highly cost-effective snack that is gaining popularity as a versatile pairing for bars and cafes.

Whether it's paired with cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam, our K-Biscuits offer a premium, export-quality option that complements the growing demand for authentic Korean snacks. Given your expertise in sourcing, I thought this might be a timely addition to the innovative lineup you’re building.

If you're exploring new products for your startup, I’d love to share more details on how we can support your growth with our specialized supply chain.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
