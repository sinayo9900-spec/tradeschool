Hi Rohan,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B distribution trends in Singapore and noticed your active involvement in the sector. Given the growing appetite for authentic K-food experiences in the local market, I wanted to reach out with something that might interest you.

We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a classic retro snack that is being rediscovered as a perfect pairing for cocktails, coffee, and even local favorites like Kaya jam. It offers a unique cost-advantage for B2B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels, making it an ideal "value-add" snack that taps into the current K-culture wave.

As a specialist in export-quality Korean snacks, we focus on providing consistent, high-volume supply to help distribution partners scale effectively. I’d love to share more about how this versatile snack is helping venues enhance their guest experience while maintaining healthy margins.

Would you be open to exploring this further or seeing a digital catalog of our current lineup?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
