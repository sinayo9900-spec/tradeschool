Hi Zeeshan,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of the F&B distribution sector in Singapore, and your expertise in navigating this landscape is truly impressive.

With the current surge in K-food popularity across Singapore’s bar and cafe scenes, I wanted to reach out regarding a product that perfectly captures this trend: the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**. 

It’s a premium yet highly cost-effective "retro" snack that is gaining traction as a versatile pairing for craft beers, cocktails, and coffee. Unlike standard bar snacks, it offers a unique storytelling element rooted in Korean culture, making it an ideal fit for distributors looking to offer something trendy yet high-margin to F&B outlets.

I’d love to share how our export-spec, high-quality biscuits can complement your current portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some samples to see if this aligns with your distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
