Hi Anthony,

I recently came across your post about the importance of culture over talent, and it truly resonated with me. Your point about how even the best efforts can fade in the wrong environment is a powerful reminder for any professional, especially in the hospitality industry where the "vibe" and culture define the guest experience.

Given your extensive background as an International Hotelier in Singapore, I’m reaching out because I believe our latest F&B offering aligns perfectly with the creative and high-standard culture you advocate for. 

We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** to the Singapore market. It’s a premium, retro-inspired snack that has become a staple in modern F&B channels. Its versatility—pairing exceptionally well with coffee, cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam—makes it an ideal, cost-effective addition to hotel bars or as a unique welcome snack that taps into the current K-food trend.

I’d love to share more about how this simple yet high-quality product can complement your F&B vision without any pressure. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
