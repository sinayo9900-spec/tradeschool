Hi Wayne,

I saw your recent post about the hiring search at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore. It’s inspiring to see your team's commitment to "hospitality from the heart" and creating those signature #FullertonMemories for your guests.

In that spirit of enhancing the guest experience, I wanted to reach out. I’m currently helping F&B managers in Singapore introduce a unique Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit) that fits perfectly into premium bar and lounge settings.

Given the rising K-food trend, these biscuits serve as an excellent, cost-effective pairing for cocktails or coffee, offering a nostalgic yet modern touch to your snack lineup. I believe they could be a subtle yet memorable addition to the world-class service at The Fullerton.

Would you be open to exploring how this might complement your current F&B offerings? I'd be happy to share more details or send over some samples for your team to review.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
