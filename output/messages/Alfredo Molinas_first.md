Hi Alfredo,

I caught your recent post about the Shopee Brands Summit—your insight that offline retail still accounts for 80% of spending was particularly striking, especially your observation that "offline retail is alive and well."

In light of that offline resilience, I wanted to reach out. I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we are introducing a premium Korean retro snack (K-Biscuit) to the Singaporean F&B landscape. It’s a highly cost-effective and versatile product that pairs excellently with the local cocktail and coffee culture, leveraging the massive K-food trend to drive offline engagement.

Given your focus on APAC market expansion and the shift toward offline retail you noted for H2, I thought this might be a timely addition to your considerations for the Singapore market.

Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas on how this could complement your current expansion strategies?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
