Hi Shilpa,

I’ve been following the dynamic shifts in Singapore’s F&B landscape, especially with the growing demand for unique, high-quality snacks that bridge the gap between tradition and modern lifestyle trends.

Given your role in the industry, I wanted to introduce a product that is currently capturing the "K-retro" wave—the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). While it carries a nostalgic charm, it has become a highly versatile, cost-effective staple for modern F&B channels.

Our K-Biscuits are specifically designed to complement bar and cafe menus. Whether paired with craft cocktails or Singapore’s favorite coffee blends, they offer a premium K-food experience that enhances the customer journey without the premium price tag. As an export-focused partner, we prioritize professional quality standards (including export-ready packaging and premium ingredients) to ensure our products align perfectly with the discerning Singaporean market.

I’d love to share more about how this versatile snack could complement your current portfolio or supply chain needs. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a product overview when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
