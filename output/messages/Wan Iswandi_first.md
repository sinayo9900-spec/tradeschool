Hi Wan,

I’ve been following the premium services offered by Wanderer Limousine Singapore and was impressed by the high standard of client experience you've built in the luxury transport sector.

With the ongoing K-food trend in Singapore, many premium service providers are looking for unique ways to add a "K-touch" to their guest experience. I’m reaching out because our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a modern, premium take on a classic retro snack—could be a sophisticated and trendy addition to your in-car amenities.

These biscuits are light, pair beautifully with coffee, and offer a unique storytelling element (Korean Retro/Military heritage) that provides a memorable experience for your international and local clients alike.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how these might fit into your premium guest offerings?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
