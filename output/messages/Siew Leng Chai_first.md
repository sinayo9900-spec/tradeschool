Hi Siew Leng,

I recently saw your post about the F&N Group's "Dinner & Dance 2025." The "Magic of Us" theme and the celebration of unity across diverse brands like Thai Beverage and BeerCo were truly inspiring to see.

Given your focus on Group TQM and Process Management, I thought you might appreciate the operational reliability and premium quality of our latest K-food export. I am Jiwoo Shin, and we are introducing a premium Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit) specifically optimized for F&B channels like bars and cafes. 

With the surging K-food trend in Singapore, our biscuits offer a cost-effective yet high-quality pairing option. Our production follows strict export-ready standards to ensure consistency and excellence, aligning with the high benchmarks set by F&N Group.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how this could complement your group's F&B portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
