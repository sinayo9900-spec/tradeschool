Dear Christine,

I hope you’re having a productive week. I’ve been following the Singapore Business Federation’s impactful work in fostering international trade and supporting innovation within the local F&B sector.

Given the current surge in K-food popularity and the evolving cocktail and cafe culture in Singapore, I’m reaching out to introduce a product that perfectly aligns with these trends—our Korean Retro Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). 

As a highly versatile and cost-effective snack, it offers a unique pairing experience for bars and cafes—complementing everything from craft cocktails to local favorites like Kaya jam. We’ve seen great potential for this to help local F&B operators diversify their menus with a trendy, "K-retro" appeal while maintaining strong margins.

I would love to share more about how this could add value to your network or explore potential synergies with SBF’s initiatives in food trade innovation.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a bit more information?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
