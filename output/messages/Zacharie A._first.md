Hi Zacharie,

I noticed your profile and your connection to the National University of Singapore. With the incredible growth of K-food trends and the vibrant F&B scene across Singapore's academic hubs, I wanted to reach out.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in premium Korean retro snacks. Our flagship K-Hardtack (Korean Hardtack Biscuit) is gaining significant traction as a versatile, cost-effective snack—perfect for pairing with coffee or as a unique campus F&B offering. As an export-specialist provider focusing on premium quality, we’ve seen how these "K-retro" flavors resonate deeply with the younger demographic who are always looking for the next trend.

Given the dynamic student environment at NUS, I thought our product might offer a fresh, trendy addition to campus events or student-led F&B initiatives.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how we might bring this K-food experience to the NUS community?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
