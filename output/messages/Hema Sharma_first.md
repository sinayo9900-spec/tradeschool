Hi Hema,

I’ve been following your expertise in Singapore’s F&B distribution sector and was impressed by your focus on bringing unique, high-quality products to the local market.

Given the significant surge in K-food popularity across Singapore’s vibrant cafe and bar scene, I wanted to share a product that is currently gaining traction as a versatile, cost-effective snack: **Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)**. 

It’s a premium retro snack that pairs exceptionally well with both coffee and cocktails, offering a unique "K-heritage" storytelling element for F&B venues looking to differentiate their side-snack offerings while maintaining strong margins. Our products are exported with high standards (ISO certified) to ensure the premium quality that Singaporean buyers expect.

Would you be open to exploring how these K-Biscuits could complement your current distribution portfolio? I'd be happy to share more details if this sounds interesting.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
