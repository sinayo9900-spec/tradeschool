Hi Stephanie, I came across your profile and was particularly interested in your background in Food Business Technology. It's rare to see that specialized technical expertise combined with a procurement role.

With the current K-food trend sweeping Singapore's F&B scene, I’m reaching out to introduce a product that bridges premium quality with high cost-efficiency: the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). 

As a retro-inspired snack, it’s gaining significant traction for its versatility—it pairs exceptionally well with the growing cocktail and craft coffee culture in Singapore. I believe it could offer a unique value-add to your current F&B distribution channels or procurement portfolio.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a product deck to see if this aligns with your sourcing goals?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
