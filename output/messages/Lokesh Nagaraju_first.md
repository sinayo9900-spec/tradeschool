Hi Lokesh,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of Singapore’s F&B scene, and as a CEO, I imagine you're always looking for unique items that can capture the current market momentum.

With the massive popularity of K-food in Singapore, I wanted to introduce a high-margin, versatile snack that's currently trending in Korea's premium F&B channels—the Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit).

It’s a retro-inspired snack that pairs exceptionally well with coffee and cocktails (even with local favorites like Kaya jam), making it a cost-effective yet trendy addition to bar and cafe menus. We specialize in export-quality biscuits and are looking for the right partners to bring this unique K-snack experience to Singapore's discerning consumers.

I'd love to share a few ideas on how this could complement your current portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
