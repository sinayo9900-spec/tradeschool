Hi Jeremy,

Big congrats on CHAGEE’s incredible growth in Singapore! Opening 17 stores in just 12 months—including the milestone at NUS—is a truly impressive feat. It’s clear that CHAGEE is successfully building a unique culture and community around premium tea.

As you continue to innovate and launch new products, I’ve been thinking about how the right snack pairing can further elevate the "CHAGEE experience." I’m currently working with a classic Korean "K-Biscuit" (Hardtack) that is seeing a major retro-revival. It’s a light, crunchy snack that pairs exceptionally well with tea, offering a nostalgic yet trendy K-food element that resonates strongly with Singapore's younger demographic.

Given your focus on purpose-driven growth and tradition, I thought this cost-effective, premium-quality snack could be a unique addition to complement your tea lineup.

Would you be open to a quick chat about how we might bring a fun K-twist to your snack options?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
