Hi Mark,

I noticed your extensive experience in the Singapore F&B distribution sector and wanted to reach out. Given the current surge in K-food trends across the city's bar and cafe scenes, I’ve seen a growing demand for unique, cost-effective snack pairings that resonate with younger consumers.

I’m currently working with a premium Korean Retro Hardtack (K-Biscuit) that is specifically designed for high-volume F&B channels. It serves as an excellent, budget-friendly alternative for bar snacks or side biscuits for coffee and cocktails, while tapping into the popular "K-retro" aesthetic.

Considering your focus on F&B distribution, I thought this might be a timely addition to your portfolio to help your clients differentiate their offerings.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to share more about how this could fit into your current lineup.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
