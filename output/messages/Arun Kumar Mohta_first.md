Hi Arun,

I've been following the dynamic growth of Singapore's F&B distribution sector, and given your professional focus in this space, I wanted to reach out with a unique opportunity.

As the demand for K-food continues to surge across Singapore, we are seeing a significant gap for versatile, high-margin snacks that cater to both the "K-retro" trend and professional F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels.

We are currently introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** to the Singaporean market. It’s a classic, premium-quality snack that offers exceptional price competitiveness, making it an ideal "complementary snack" for bars or a unique pairing for cafes (it works wonderfully with coffee or local favorites like Kaya jam). 

With our focus on export-ready quality and consistent supply, I believe this could be a strong, high-volume addition to your distribution portfolio.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving a digital brochure to see if this aligns with your current distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
