Hi Yang Lih,

Congratulations to you and the team at Raffles Hotel Singapore for being ranked #5 on The World’s 50 Best Hotels 2025 list! It is a remarkable achievement and a testament to the pursuit of excellence and gracious hospitality that Raffles consistently delivers.

I am reaching out because I’ve been following the innovative F&B curation at Raffles. With the rising global interest in premium K-food, I believe our Korean Retro Hardtack Biscuits could offer a unique and sophisticated addition to your world-class bar and café offerings.

Our biscuits provide a nostalgic yet refined experience, making them an excellent high-quality pairing for artisanal coffee or signature cocktails. Given your focus on maintaining a legendary legacy while embracing modern trends, this "K-Retro" snack could be a distinctive touchpoint for your guests seeking both comfort and novelty.

If you are open to exploring new snack pairings that align with your current F&B strategy, I would love to share more details or send some samples for your team to review.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
