Hi Cédric,

I was fascinated by your recent post about the "Five Blessings" shophouse cake—it’s a beautiful example of the creativity and meaningful storytelling you foster at the Singapore EDITION.

Since your team clearly values pushing boundaries in F&B, I thought you might be interested in a classic Korean element that is gaining new life in premium settings. We specialize in premium Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit), a retro snack that pairs exceptionally well with craft cocktails and coffee due to its unique crunch and subtle profile.

Given the massive K-food trend in Singapore, I believe this "retro-cool" snack could offer a distinctive and cost-effective addition to your lounge or bar programs, aligning with the EDITION’s vision for unique guest experiences.

Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps seeing some samples to see if this aligns with your upcoming F&B concepts?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin""")
