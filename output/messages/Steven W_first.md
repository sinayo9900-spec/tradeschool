Hi Steven,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B scene and noticed your expertise in the industry. Given the current surge in K-food trends across the region, I wanted to reach out.

We specialize in premium, export-grade **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**. These are a classic "retro" snack that we’ve refined for professional F&B channels. They are ISO-certified and offer a unique, cost-effective pairing for craft cocktails and coffee—making them an ideal "house snack" for bars and cafes looking to add a touch of Korean flair to their menu.

I’d love to share how these could complement your current product lineup or upcoming projects. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a bit more information?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
