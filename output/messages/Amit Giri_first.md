Hi Amit,

I’ve been following your extensive background in commodities trade and sourcing with great interest. Given your expertise in global trading and business development, I wanted to reach out regarding a notable shift we’re seeing in the Singapore F&B landscape.

The demand for authentic K-food is reaching a new peak, and we are currently introducing Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) to the market. As a classic Korean retro snack, it offers exceptional price competitiveness and versatility—making it an ideal side snack for bars, cafes, and hotel F&B channels. Its unique profile allows for creative pairings, from craft cocktails to local favorites like Kaya jam, offering a fresh way to tap into the K-culture trend.

I thought this might align with your current sourcing interests or provide a strategic addition for your F&B partners looking for cost-effective, high-demand items. Would you be open to a brief exchange to explore if this could be a fit for your portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
