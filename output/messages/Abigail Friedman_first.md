Hi Abigail,

I’ve been closely following the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore, and the creative ways local brands are integrating international flavors is truly impressive. Given the surging interest in K-food trends and premium pairing experiences, I wanted to reach out.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in **Korean Retro Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a versatile, export-quality snack that's gaining significant traction as a high-margin alternative for F&B channels. 

Our K-Biscuits offer a unique value proposition:
*   **Cost-Efficiency**: Ideal as a high-quality complimentary bar snack or side-service biscuit.
*   **Versatile Pairing**: Excellent for coffee/cocktail pairings and even local twists like Kaya jam combinations.
*   **K-Trend Appeal**: Taps into the Singaporean youth's interest in authentic Korean retro culture.

I believe these could be a great cost-effective addition to complement your current lineup and enhance the customer experience. 

If this sounds like something that might align with your procurement goals, I’d be happy to share more details or send over some concepts for menu integration.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
