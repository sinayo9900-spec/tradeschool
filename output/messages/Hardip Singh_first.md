Hi Hardip,

I came across your profile and noticed your extensive involvement in Singapore's F&B distribution landscape. Given your expertise in the sector, I wanted to reach out regarding a trending opportunity in the local snack market.

As K-food continues to gain massive traction in Singapore, we are seeing a growing demand for unique yet cost-effective accompaniments in the bar and cafe scene. We specialize in **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a premium, retro-style snack that offers exceptional value for money.

They are incredibly versatile, serving as a perfect pairing for coffee or cocktails, and even as a base for local twists like Kaya jam pairings. With their "K-retro" storytelling appeal and high cost-efficiency, they could be a strategic addition to your current product lineup to capture the interest of younger, K-culture-savvy consumers.

I’d love to share more about our concept and how it fits the Singaporean F&B market. Would you be open to a brief exchange when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
