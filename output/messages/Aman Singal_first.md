Hi Aman,

I've been following the dynamic growth of Singapore's F&B distribution sector, and I've noticed how quickly the market adapts to global food trends.

I’m reaching out because we are currently introducing a versatile Korean snack to the Singaporean market that I believe would be a perfect fit for your distribution portfolio—**Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**. 

With the massive surge in K-food popularity, these biscuits offer a unique "K-retro" appeal. They are exceptionally cost-competitive and serve as an ideal high-margin side snack for bars, cafes, and hotels, especially when paired with coffee or cocktails. We ensure premium quality and export-ready standards (including ISO-certified processes) to meet the expectations of Singapore’s top-tier F&B channels.

I’d love to share a brief deck or discuss how this could complement your current product lineup. Would you be open to a quick chat sometime next week?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
