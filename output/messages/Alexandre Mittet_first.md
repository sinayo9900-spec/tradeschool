Hi Alexandre,

I've been following ExtenC’s impressive work in F&B distribution and your focus on high-potential market trends. With the K-food surge in Singapore, I thought our "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit) might be a great addition to your portfolio.

It’s a cost-effective, retro-style snack that pairs exceptionally well with local bar and cafe menus (great with Kaya jam!). As we specialize in export-grade quality with premium standards, I believe it offers a unique competitive edge for your distribution channels.

Would you be open to a brief chat to explore if there's a fit for ExtenC’s upcoming plans?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
