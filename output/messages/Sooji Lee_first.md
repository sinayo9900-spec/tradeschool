Hi Sooji,

I’ve been following 육조상사’s success in bringing quality Korean food products to the Singapore market.

Given the strong K-food trend and the vibrant F&B scene in Singapore, our "K-Biscuit" (Korean Hardtack) could be a great addition to your portfolio. It’s a cost-effective, retro-style snack that pairs perfectly with cocktails and coffee, making it ideal for your bar and cafe channels.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this fits your current procurement needs?
