Hi Sooji, I noticed you're working in F&B distribution here in Singapore with a focus on Korean food products — that's a space we're really excited about too.

We supply Korean hardtack biscuits, a classic retro snack that's been getting great traction as a bar bite and coffee pairing in the local F&B scene. A few spots have started featuring them as a unique K-snack option, and the reception has been really positive.

Would love to hear if this is something that could complement your current Korean product lineup?
