Dear Dr. Brem,

I have been following your insights into the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore, particularly your focus on sustainable sourcing and innovative consumer trends. Your perspective on how global flavors are being integrated into the local market is truly impressive.

I am reaching out because we are currently introducing a unique "Korean Retro" snack to the Singaporean market that I believe aligns perfectly with the current K-food wave and the growing demand for versatile, cost-effective F&B solutions. 

Our "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit) is designed as a premium yet highly competitive pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels. It offers a nostalgic K-food experience that complements everything from specialty coffee to craft cocktails—especially when paired with local favorites like Kaya jam. As an export specialist committed to high quality and scalability, we focus on helping F&B partners enhance their snack offerings without compromising on margin or authenticity.

Would you be open to a brief introduction or perhaps receiving a sample pack to see how this might complement your current portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
