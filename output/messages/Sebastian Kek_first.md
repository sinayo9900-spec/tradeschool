Hi Sebastian,

I’ve been following Mr Bean’s impressive growth and your role in maintaining its position as a go-to spot for healthy, local snacks in Singapore.

With the current K-food trend sweeping through the local F&B scene, I’m reaching out because I believe our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) could be a unique and complementary addition to your snack lineup. As an export-specialized product with premium quality standards, it offers that nostalgic "Korean retro" feel that resonates well with the younger demographic in Singapore.

Our biscuits are highly versatile—perfect as a standalone healthy snack or even paired with your signature soy-based beverages. I’d love to share how these have been performing in similar F&B channels and discuss if they might fit Mr Bean’s curated selection.

Would you be open to a brief chat to explore this further?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
