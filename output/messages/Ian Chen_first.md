Hi Ian,

I've been following the recent shifts in Singapore’s F&B distribution landscape, particularly the growing demand for unique, versatile snacks that bridge the gap between traditional comfort and modern trends.

Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I wanted to reach out regarding a product that's currently seeing a huge "retro-cool" resurgence in Korea: the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**.

It’s an exceptionally cost-effective option that works perfectly as a base bar snack or a unique pairing for Singapore’s thriving coffee and cocktail scene. We’ve seen great success positioning it not just as a standalone snack, but as a versatile ingredient for local favorites like Kaya jam pairings or creative dessert toppings. 

Since you handle F&B distribution, I thought this might be a high-margin addition to your current portfolio that taps into the ongoing K-food momentum in Singapore.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with your current distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
