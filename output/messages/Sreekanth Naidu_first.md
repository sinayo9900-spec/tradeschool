Hi Sreekanth,

I hope you’re having a productive week. I’ve been following the vibrant growth of Singapore’s F&B and hospitality sector and noticed your expertise in the industry.

With the current momentum of K-food trends across Singapore, I’m reaching out to introduce a unique "Korean Retro Snack" (K-Biscuit) that is proving to be a highly effective and cost-competitive pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels. 

Our K-Biscuits offer a premium crunch and nostalgic appeal that fits perfectly as a complimentary bar snack or a creative side for coffee and Kaya jam pairings. We specialize in export-quality production with high-volume supply capabilities, specifically designed to help F&B operators enhance their guest experience while maintaining excellent cost efficiency.

I’d love to share our product lookbook with you if you think this could be a valuable addition to your current lineup. Would you be open to a brief exchange when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
