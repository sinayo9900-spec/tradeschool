Hi Jasdeep,

I’ve been following your impressive track record in global supply chain management and strategic sourcing. Your expertise in optimizing complex procurement processes and your background in Agribusiness are truly remarkable.

I’m reaching out because we are currently introducing a high-demand 'Korean Retro Biscuit' (K-Biscuit) specifically tailored for the Singapore F&B and hospitality sectors. Given the massive K-food trend in the region, this product offers an exceptional cost-to-quality ratio, making it a perfect, cost-effective snack pairing for bars, cafes, and premium hotels looking to enhance their offerings.

Given your leadership in strategic sourcing, I thought this might align with your interest in high-potential products that balance quality with supply chain efficiency.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this could be a valuable addition to your sourcing network for the Singapore market?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
