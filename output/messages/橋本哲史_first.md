Hello Tetsushi-san,

I was impressed by your focus on the Halal market and your extensive trade network across Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

I’m reaching out because we’ve developed a Halal-certified version of the popular Korean "K-Biscuit" (Retro Hardtack). It is a highly cost-effective and versatile snack that's currently gaining traction by leveraging the global K-food trend, making it an excellent fit for bar pairings and F&B channels.

Given your expertise in exporting products to the Halal market, I thought this might be a valuable addition for your partners in Malaysia, Indonesia, or the UAE.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this fits your current trade portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
