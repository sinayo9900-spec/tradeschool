Hi Joshua,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore and noticed your impressive work within the industry. Given the growing appetite for unique K-food experiences, I wanted to reach out and share something that's been gaining a lot of traction.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we specialize in bringing premium Korean retro snacks to international markets. We are currently introducing our "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit) to Singapore, specifically designed as a high-margin, trendy alternative for bar snacks and cafe pairings.

What makes this interesting for the Singapore market is its versatility—it pairs exceptionally well with specialty coffee, cocktails, and even local favorites like Kaya jam. It’s a cost-effective way to tap into the K-retro trend while maintaining a premium guest experience. Our products are export-certified and ready for large-scale supply.

I’d love to share some of our creative pairing concepts or send over a few samples to see if this could complement your current lineup. Would you be open to a brief chat about this?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
