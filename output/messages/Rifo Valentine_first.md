Hi Rifo,

I’ve been following your insights on supply chain enthusiasm and your impressive work as an MC and Event Organizer. It’s rare to find someone who balances the precision of procurement with such high-energy public engagement.

I’m reaching out because we are seeing a significant trend in Singapore where F&B and event sectors are looking for authentic, cost-effective "K-food" elements to enhance their offerings. We are currently introducing the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)—a premium, export-quality retro snack that’s gaining traction for its versatility, especially as a unique pairing for coffee, cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam.

Given your procurement expertise and your role in organizing standout events, I thought this might be a fresh, budget-friendly addition to your supply chain portfolio or a unique highlight for your upcoming projects.

I’d love to share more about how this is being utilized in the local market if you're interested. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
