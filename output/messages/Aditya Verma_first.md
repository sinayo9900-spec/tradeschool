Hi Aditya,

I came across your profile and was impressed by your work within Singapore's F&B distribution network. Given your expertise in navigating the local food scene, I wanted to reach out regarding a new K-food opportunity.

We are currently introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a classic retro snack—to the Singaporean market. With the ongoing surge in K-food popularity, we’ve seen great potential for this product as a versatile, cost-effective side snack for bars, cafes, and hotel F&B channels.

It pairs exceptionally well with coffee and cocktails, offering a unique "K-retro" storytelling element that appeals to the younger demographic. I believe it could be a highly competitive addition to a distribution portfolio looking for high-volume, trendy snack options.

I'd love to share some details on our Bar Snack Packs and see if this aligns with any of your current distribution goals. Would you be open to a quick exchange of ideas?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
