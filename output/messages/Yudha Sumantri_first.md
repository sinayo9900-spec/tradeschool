Hi Yudha,

I noticed your recent post about sourcing non-pneumatic filling and sealing machines for your packaging operations. It’s clear you have a sharp eye for efficient procurement and high-quality equipment standards at Eatwell.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and I’m reaching out because we specialize in exporting premium Korean F&B products that are currently gaining significant traction in the Singapore market. Given your expertise in sourcing and supplier management, I thought our **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** might be a strategic addition to your current product lineup.

As an export-professional supplier focused on premium quality, we offer a highly cost-effective snack solution that taps into the booming K-food trend. Our biscuits are incredibly versatile—perfect as a staple bar/cafe snack or as a unique retail item with a compelling "Korean retro" storytelling element.

Would you be open to receiving our product catalog to see if this fits Eatwell’s sourcing goals for the coming season?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
