Hi Benoît,

I’ve been following Blue Whale’s impressive marketing initiatives across Asia, and I’m particularly impressed by how you’ve positioned premium French produce in such a dynamic region.

Given your expertise in the Asian F&B landscape, I wanted to reach out regarding a growing trend we’re seeing in Singapore. We are currently introducing a premium **Korean Retro Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a versatile, cost-effective snack that is becoming a popular pairing choice in modern bars and cafes.

Just as Blue Whale sets the standard for quality fruit, we focus on delivering professional, export-ready products (ISO certified) that tap into the current K-food wave. I believe this "K-retro" concept could be a unique addition to the local F&B repertoire, offering both novelty and high value.

I’d love to share more about our vision for the Singapore market and see if this aligns with any of your current interests or network needs. Would you be open to a brief chat?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
