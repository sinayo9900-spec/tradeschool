Hi Marc,

I’ve been following your work in the Singaporean F&B space and noticed the impressive growth in market engagement your team has been driving.

I'm reaching out because I believe there's a unique opportunity to capitalize on the current K-food wave in Singapore. We specialize in **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a classic retro snack that’s becoming a trendy, cost-effective staple for bars, cafes, and hotels.

With the rising popularity of K-culture, these biscuits offer a perfect 'retro-cool' storytelling element for your portfolio. They are incredibly versatile, serving as an excellent pairing for coffee or cocktails, or even as a unique base for local favorites like Kaya jam.

Given your role in Sales and Marketing, I thought this might be an interesting high-margin addition to your current F&B lineup to attract the younger, K-trend-conscious demographic.

If you're interested, I'd love to share more about how we can integrate this into the Singapore market. No pressure for a meeting yet—just let me know if this sounds like something worth exploring.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
