Hi Gildas,

I’ve been following your impressive track record in Global Sourcing and Private Label development across major retail platforms like RedMart and Lazada. Given your expertise in FMCG and grocery procurement, I wanted to reach out regarding a strategic opportunity within the booming K-food category in Singapore.

We are currently helping retail and F&B partners capitalize on the "Korean Retro" trend with our K-Biscuits (Korean Hardtack). They are high-volume, cost-effective snacks that offer a unique alternative to traditional biscuits—perfect for private labels or as a versatile pairing for Singapore’s growing cafe and bar scene.

Considering your focus on sourcing high-demand products that balance quality and price competitiveness, I believe these could be a valuable addition to your current portfolio.

I’d love to share some insights on how this category is performing in the region and discuss potential fit for your upcoming procurement cycles. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
