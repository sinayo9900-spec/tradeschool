Hi Raj,

I've been following the innovative F&B initiatives at Meuse Hotel & Hospitality, and I’m impressed by how you're consistently elevating the guest experience in Singapore's competitive market.

I'm reaching out because we're seeing a significant surge in the "K-food retro" trend, particularly with premium snack pairings. We provide Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a versatile, cost-effective snack that pairs exceptionally well with both specialty coffee and craft cocktails. 

Given your focus on F&B management, I believe this could be a high-margin addition to your current bar or café offerings, tapping into the local demand for authentic K-food experiences. Our products are produced with export-level expertise to ensure the premium quality required for hotel environments.

I’d love to share some pairing concepts that have worked well for similar F&B channels. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
