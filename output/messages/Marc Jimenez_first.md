Hi Marc,

I’ve been following Sweetgreen’s leadership in sustainable sourcing and your commitment to building transparent, high-quality supply chains. Given your focus on impactful food partnerships, I wanted to introduce a unique element from the K-food space that aligns with current consumer trends.

We are currently introducing Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) to the Singapore F&B market. As a traditional "retro" snack, it offers a clean-label, plant-based profile that fits perfectly with the growing demand for authentic and versatile ingredients. Whether as a cost-effective side, a crunchy topping, or a unique pairing for beverage programs, it captures the "K-food" momentum that is currently driving significant engagement among younger demographics.

I’d love to share how our focus on premium quality and export-ready standards could complement Sweetgreen’s vision for innovative sourcing.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this might be a fit for your upcoming procurement goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
