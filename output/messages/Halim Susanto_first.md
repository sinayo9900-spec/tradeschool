Hi Halim,

I’ve been following your impressive work in driving sales growth across Modern and General Trade. Your expertise in navigating the diverse retail and F&B landscape in Singapore is truly inspiring.

Given the surging interest in K-food trends within the local market, I thought our latest product might be a great fit for your current portfolio. We specialize in Korean Retro Hardtack (K-Biscuit)—a versatile, cost-effective snack that’s gaining massive traction as a unique bar pairing and a trendy addition to retail displays.

Our biscuits are produced with export-grade quality and offer a high-margin opportunity for F&B channels looking to capitalize on the Korean wave. I believe this could be a great complement to the diverse range of products you manage.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with your sales goals for this year?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
