Hi Vijay, I hope you’re having a great week.

I’ve been closely following the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore, especially the growing demand for unique, high-value snack pairings in the bar and cafe scene.

I’m Jiwoo from the team introducing "Korean Retro Hardtack" (K-Biscuit) to the Singapore market. It’s a versatile, cost-effective snack that taps perfectly into the current K-food trend. Whether it’s served as a complimentary bar snack or paired with local favorites like Kaya jam, it offers a distinct experience for customers looking for something nostalgic yet trendy.

Given your background in the industry, I thought this might be a timely addition to your menu strategy or procurement lineup. We focus on high-quality, export-ready products (ISO certified) that offer excellent margins.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a product deck to see if it aligns with your upcoming plans?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
