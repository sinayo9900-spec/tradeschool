Hi Ann,

I hope this message finds you well. I’ve been following the vibrant F&B distribution scene in Singapore and noticed your expertise in the sector.

Given the current surge in K-food popularity across Singapore, I wanted to introduce a high-value item that’s been performing exceptionally well in Korea's F&B channels—our Korean Retro Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit).

It’s a versatile, cost-effective snack that pairs perfectly with coffee or cocktails, making it an ideal choice for bars and cafes looking to enhance their side-snack offerings. With the growing interest in retro K-culture, it offers a unique storytelling angle for the local market.

I’d love to share more about how this could complement your current distribution portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps receiving a product deck?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
