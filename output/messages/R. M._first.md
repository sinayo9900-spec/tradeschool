Hi R. M.,

I’ve been following your profile and your expertise in the F&B distribution sector here in Singapore. Given your focus on sourcing high-quality products that resonate with local consumer trends, I wanted to reach out and introduce a unique opportunity.

We are currently launching our premium **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** in the Singapore market. As you may have noticed, the demand for authentic K-food is surging, and our K-Biscuit offers a perfect blend of retro storytelling and modern versatility.

What makes this product a strategic fit for the Singaporean F&B landscape:
- **Exceptional Cost-Efficiency**: Ideal for high-volume supply to bars, cafes, and hotels as a primary side snack.
- **Versatile Pairing**: It pairs beautifully with local favorites like Kaya jam, artisanal coffee, and even craft cocktails.
- **Premium Quality**: Our products are ISO-certified and manufactured to the highest export standards, ensuring reliability for professional distribution.

I’d love to share more about how this versatile snack can complement your current portfolio and tap into the growing K-snack trend. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas or receiving a product overview when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
