Hi Jeremy,

I came across your profile and was impressed by your energy as a "Business Enabler" and your proactive approach to merchant acquisition in the F&B sector. Given your focus on driving performance for food merchants, I thought you might be interested in a high-potential item currently making waves in the K-food scene.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we are introducing a premium Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit) specifically tailored for Singapore’s F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels. With the rising K-food trend, these biscuits offer an exceptional, cost-effective pairing for cocktails and coffee—providing that unique "K-vibe" that attracts the younger demographic while maintaining healthy margins for merchants.

Since you are deeply connected with food merchants looking for their next competitive edge, I believe our export-quality biscuits could be a perfect fit for your network's portfolio.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how these K-biscuits can add value to the merchants you work with?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
