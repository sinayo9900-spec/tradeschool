Hi Nurman,

I’ve been following the vibrant F&B landscape in Singapore and noticed the impressive growth in demand for unique K-food concepts.

I'm reaching out because we specialize in a premium Korean retro snack—K-Biscuit (Hardtack)—which has become a highly cost-effective and trendy pairing for bars and cafes. Given your expertise in the industry, I believe our product could be a strategic addition to complement your current snack lineup and tap into the local K-culture trend.

Would you be open to a brief introduction to see how this could add value to your offerings?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
