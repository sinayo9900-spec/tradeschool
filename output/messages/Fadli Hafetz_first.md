Hi Fadli,

I’ve been following Power Root ALICAFE’s impressive growth in the regional market, and your focus on shopper marketing strategy and engagement is truly insightful.

Given the surging popularity of K-food trends in Singapore, I’m reaching out because I see a unique synergy between your beverage portfolio and our **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**. These retro snacks have become a massive hit as a versatile pairing for premium coffee—offering a light, crunchy texture that complements the rich flavors of ALICAFE products perfectly.

As a Shopper Marketing Manager, you might find interest in how this cost-effective, high-quality snack could enhance the "coffee experience" at the point of sale, whether through retail bundling or cross-category promotions.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how we might create some interesting synergy for your Singaporean consumers?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
