Hi Stanley,

I’ve been closely following the dynamic F&B distribution trends in Singapore, particularly how distributors are increasingly looking for unique, high-quality snacks to elevate the local hospitality and retail scene.

I’m reaching out because our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits / Gunppang) have been gaining significant traction as a versatile and cost-effective pairing for both specialty coffee and craft cocktails. With the current K-food wave in Singapore, these retro-inspired snacks offer a nostalgic storytelling element that resonates particularly well with younger consumers and modern F&B venues.

As an export-ready supplier adhering to strict ISO standards, we provide premium quality at a highly competitive price point, ensuring excellent margins for our distribution partners. Whether it’s for a specialty cafe or a high-end bar, these biscuits serve as a perfect, low-cost/high-impact addition to any product portfolio.

I’d love to share some of our successful pairing concepts or discuss how these might fit into your current distribution channels. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
