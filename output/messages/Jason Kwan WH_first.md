Hi Jason,

I recently saw your post about RiBert’s arrival in Jakarta—I love the "hands-on service hero" concept and the emphasis on providing personal, drama-free support to the industry. It’s clear that Rittal values a human touch in technical operations.

As you manage regional operations across ASEAN, I thought you might be interested in a unique way to enhance your corporate hospitality or office pantry. We specialize in exporting premium **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**, a retro-inspired snack that is currently a major K-food trend in Singapore. 

Our products are produced with high-level professional standards (ISO certified) and offer a perfect balance of premium quality and cost-effectiveness. Given the growing interest in K-food among professionals in Singapore, these biscuits serve as an excellent, conversation-starting snack for client meetings or team breaks.

I’d love to share more about our export-ready lineup and how they could fit into your regional office environment. Would you be open to a brief chat or seeing some of our product details?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
