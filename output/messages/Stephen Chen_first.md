Hi Stephen,

I’ve been following KAS Group Asia’s impressive work in streamlining F&B distribution networks across the region. Given your focus on International Supply Chain, I thought you might find a high-potential opportunity within the Singapore F&B sector particularly interesting.

We are introducing a premium Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit) specifically optimized for high-volume F&B channels. With the growing trend of K-food in Singapore, we’ve seen how this cost-effective, high-quality biscuit can significantly enhance the value proposition for bars, cafes, and hospitality partners as a signature side snack.

Our supply chain structure is built for scalability and consistent quality (ISO certified), which I believe aligns well with the standards KAS Group Asia maintains for its distribution portfolio.

Would you be open to a brief discussion or receiving a product deck to see if this fits within your current procurement strategy?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
