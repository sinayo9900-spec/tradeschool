Hi Sebastian,

I recently saw your post highlighting the Welcome Desk team and Tat Qin Tan at W Singapore - Sentosa Cove. It’s clear that creating a vibrant, professional, and fun environment for both talent and guests is a core priority for you.

Given W Hotels' reputation for trend-setting guest experiences, I’m reaching out because I believe our latest F&B concept could add a unique "K-flavor" to your offerings. We are introducing a premium **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** to the Singapore market—a retro-inspired snack that perfectly taps into the current K-food trend among trend-conscious travelers.

It is an incredibly versatile product that pairs exceptionally well with creative cocktails at your bars or functions as a nostalgic, high-quality welcome amenity. In fact, it’s been gaining traction when paired with local elements like Kaya jam, offering a perfect bridge between Korean heritage and Singaporean culture.

I’d love to share how this cost-effective yet premium snack could complement the unique guest journey at W Singapore. If you’re interested, I’d be happy to provide more details or explore some pairing ideas together.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
