Hi Remco,

I’ve been following your insights on international dairy markets and global commodity sourcing—your strategic leadership in navigating global trade is truly impressive.

Given your deep expertise in food supply chains and trading, I wanted to reach out regarding a high-growth F&B opportunity we are expanding in Singapore: the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). While it’s a premium quality, export-specialized product (ISO certified), what makes it unique is its versatility in the F&B sector—it’s currently trending as a high-margin pairing for bars and cafes. 

Interestingly, one of its most popular "hacks" is being served with milk (like a retro cereal), which I thought might be a curious point of interest given your background in the dairy sector. Beyond that, its price competitiveness and alignment with the current K-food trend make it an excellent candidate for diversifying local snack portfolios.

I’d love to share more about our supply structure and how this fits into the current Singaporean F&B landscape. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
