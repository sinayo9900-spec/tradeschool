Hi Florence,

I’ve been following your work in Singapore’s F&B distribution space and was impressed by your focus on identifying high-potential products for the local market.

Given the current surge in K-food popularity across Singapore’s F&B scene, I wanted to reach out regarding a unique opportunity. We are introducing a premium **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a retro-inspired, cost-effective snack that is proving to be a perfect fit for bars, cafes, and hospitality channels.

What makes it stand out is its incredible versatility; it pairs beautifully with coffee and cocktails, and can even be localized with Kaya jam. I believe this could be a highly competitive and complementary addition to your existing distribution portfolio.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with your current goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
