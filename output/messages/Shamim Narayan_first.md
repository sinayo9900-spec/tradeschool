Hi Shamim,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of Singapore's F&B sector and noticed your extensive experience in driving sales leadership. Given the current surge in K-food popularity across the region, I wanted to share something that aligns perfectly with these market shifts.

We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**—a premium retro snack that is becoming a favorite in modern F&B channels. Its unique "K-retro" appeal and versatile pairing profile make it an ideal choice for bars and cafes looking for high-margin, cost-effective side snacks to pair with cocktails or coffee.

Our products are produced with strict export-quality standards (ISO certified) to ensure they meet the high expectations of the Singaporean market. I believe this could be a strategic addition to your current portfolio to capture the interest of younger, trend-conscious consumers.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how we can support your distribution goals with this unique K-snack?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
