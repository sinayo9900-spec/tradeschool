Hi Ayesha,

I’ve been closely following the vibrant F&B scene in Singapore and noticed how the demand for authentic yet versatile K-food experiences continues to grow.

I’m reaching out because I believe our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) could be a fantastic addition to your current offerings. These are classic retro snacks that are gaining significant traction as a cost-effective, premium-quality pairing for bars and cafes—working perfectly with everything from cocktails to local favorites like Kaya jam.

We specialize in export-ready, high-volume supply (ISO certified) designed to help F&B partners tap into the K-food trend while maintaining excellent margins.

Would you be open to a brief chat about how these might complement your snack lineup?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
