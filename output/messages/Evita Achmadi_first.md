Hi Evita,

I’ve been following your work in food product development and bakery specialism—your expertise in formulation and food safety is truly impressive.

Given the surging interest in K-food trends within Singapore's F&B scene, I wanted to reach out regarding a unique item that bridges retro charm with modern versatility: the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit).

As a Bakery Specialist, I thought you might find its potential interesting. It’s not just a standalone snack; its texture and cost-competitiveness make it a versatile pairing for bars and cafes, and even a unique base for creative bakery formulations. We focus on premium quality and are currently looking for ways to complement the local F&B lineup in Singapore.

I'd love to hear your professional thoughts on how a classic K-snack like this might resonate with the local market or your current projects. Would you be open to a brief chat when you have a moment?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
