Hi Joyce,

I’ve been following the F&B supply chain landscape in Singapore and noticed your leadership in optimizing sourcing strategies. 

Given the surging interest in K-food trends across the region, I’m reaching out to introduce our export-grade Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits). They are specifically designed for high-volume F&B channels like bars and cafes, offering a unique "retro" appeal with exceptional cost-efficiency. I believe these could be a strategic addition to your snack portfolio to meet the growing demand for authentic K-food while maintaining healthy margins.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this fits your upcoming supply chain plans?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
