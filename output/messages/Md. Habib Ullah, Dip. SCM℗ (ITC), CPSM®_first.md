Hi Md. Habib Ullah,

I’ve been following your professional journey as a Supply Chain Practitioner and have greatly admired your expertise in procurement leadership, particularly within the global F&B landscape.

Given your deep understanding of supply chain excellence and the current market dynamics in Singapore, I wanted to reach out regarding a significant trend we’re observing: the rising demand for authentic, cost-effective Korean snacks that pair seamlessly with diverse beverage categories.

We are currently introducing a premium Korean retro snack—the Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)—to the Singapore market. Its unique versatility makes it an ideal "pairing snack" for F&B channels, offering both exceptional cost-efficiency and the strong "K-food" brand appeal that resonates with today’s consumers. Whether it's for premium hospitality or high-volume F&B outlets, it provides a unique value proposition in the current competitive environment.

I thought this might be an interesting concept to share with a procurement expert of your caliber, considering how it aligns with modern F&B pairing trends and efficient sourcing strategies.

Would you be open to a brief exchange on how this product might complement the local F&B ecosystem or your current procurement interests?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
