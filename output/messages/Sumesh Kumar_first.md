Hi Sumesh,

I’ve been following your work in international trade logistics and procurement. Given your expertise in managing import-export portfolios in Singapore, I wanted to reach out regarding a high-demand opportunity in the K-food sector that aligns with recent market trends.

We are an export specialist providing **Korean Retro Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**, which are seeing significant traction as a cost-effective, premium-quality snack for F&B channels. Our products are optimized for high-volume supply and follow strict quality standards, making them an ideal fit for procurement leaders looking to capitalize on the "K-wave" trend while ensuring supply chain efficiency and margin protection.

Our K-Biscuits offer excellent pairing versatility—from bar snacks to cafe sides—providing a unique value proposition that complements existing product lines. I'd love to share how our export-ready solutions can support your sourcing strategy for the upcoming season.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving our digital catalog to see if this aligns with your procurement needs?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
