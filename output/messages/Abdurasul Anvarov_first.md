Hi Abdurasul,

I hope you're having a productive week.

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of the F&B distribution sector in Singapore and noticed how the market is increasingly gravitating towards unique, versatile snack options that bridge the gap between tradition and modern trends.

I’m reaching out to you because we are introducing a Korean retro classic—the **K-Biscuit (Hardtack)**—specifically tailored for the Singaporean market. As K-food continues to trend, our K-Biscuit offers an exceptional value proposition: it is highly cost-effective and serves as a perfect pairing for craft cocktails, specialty coffee, and even local favorites like Kaya jam.

Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I believe this could be a high-potential addition to your current portfolio, especially for clients in the bar, cafe, and hospitality sectors looking for premium yet affordable snack solutions.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving a digital brochure to see how this K-food trend could complement your distribution lineup?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
