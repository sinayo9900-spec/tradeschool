Hi Rafeek, I recently saw your post about the hiring drive at Conrad Singapore Marina Bay—congratulations on the continued growth of the #WeAreHilton team! It’s inspiring to see such commitment to being a Great Place to Work.

Given Conrad’s reputation for luxury and exceptional guest experiences, I’m reaching out to introduce a unique F&B addition: the Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). With the booming K-food trend in Singapore, these premium retro snacks offer a sophisticated yet cost-effective pairing for your hotel’s cocktail lounges and coffee services.

I’d love to explore how our K-Biscuits could complement your current offerings and enhance the guest experience. Could you please direct me to the appropriate contact in your F&B or Procurement department, or would you be open to a brief chat?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
