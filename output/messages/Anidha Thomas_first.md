Hi Anidha,

I’ve been closely following the dynamic F&B trends in Singapore, particularly how venues are increasingly integrating unique K-food elements to engage the younger demographic.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a premium "Korean Retro Snack" (K-Biscuit) that is specifically designed for the high-volume needs of Singapore's bars, cafes, and hotels. As K-food continues to trend, this snack offers an excellent way to elevate your side-dish offerings with a authentic, nostalgic touch.

Our K-Biscuits are produced to export-grade quality standards and offer incredible pairing versatility—from cocktail side-snacks to creative pairings with specialty coffee or local Kaya jam. It’s a cost-effective solution that taps into the premium image of Korean food without the high overhead of typical imported snacks.

I’d love to share our product concept and some successful pairing cases if you're open to exploring new additions to your F&B portfolio.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
