Hi Villisia,

I’ve been following Ismaya Group’s impressive growth in the F&B and lifestyle sector. Your ability to curate unique dining experiences across the region is truly inspiring.

I'm reaching out because we're seeing a significant surge in K-food interest within the region's F&B channels. We provide premium Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a cost-effective, high-quality "retro" snack that’s gaining traction as a versatile pairing for bars and cafes.

Given your oversight of the supply chain, I thought our export-ready products could offer a high-margin, trendy addition to your venues’ snack menus or F&B pairings.

If you’re open to exploring new K-snack concepts for Ismaya's portfolio, I’d love to share more.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
