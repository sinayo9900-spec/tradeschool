Hi Ashish,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of the F&B scene in Singapore, particularly how local venues are successfully integrating global food trends into their offerings.

With the current surge in K-food popularity across the city-state, I wanted to reach out regarding a unique opportunity to enhance your snack lineup. We are introducing **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a classic retro snack that is perfectly positioned for Singapore’s evolving bar and cafe culture.

Given their incredible price competitiveness and "K-Retro" aesthetic, they serve as an excellent high-margin pairing for craft cocktails, specialty coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam. It’s a simple way to tap into the K-culture trend while maintaining a healthy bottom line for your procurement.

Would you be open to receiving a brief product deck to see if these could be a fit for your upcoming snack rotations?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
