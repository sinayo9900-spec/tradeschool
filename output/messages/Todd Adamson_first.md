Hi Todd,

I’ve been following your impressive track record in FMCG procurement and brand development. Your expertise in navigating the import/export landscape and managing P&L for successful brands is truly remarkable.

Given your eye for high-potential products, I wanted to reach out regarding the explosive K-food trend in Singapore. We are seeing incredible traction with our Korean Hardtack (K-Biscuit)—a premium, export-quality retro snack that offers exceptional cost-competitiveness for F&B channels like bars, hotels, and cafes.

What makes it unique for the Singaporean market is its versatility; it pairs perfectly with cocktails as a base snack or even with local favorites like Kaya jam for a fusion twist. We specialize in high-margin, export-ready products (ISO certified) that align with current consumer cravings for authentic K-culture experiences.

I’d love to share some insights on how this could complement your current portfolio or procurement goals. Would you be open to a brief introduction?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
