Hi Ying Yin,

I came across your profile and was quite impressed by your extensive background in demand planning, especially your time at Mondelez and your current role at Luxasia. Given your expertise in navigating consumer trends and supply chain complexities in Singapore, I thought you might appreciate the unique positioning of a project I’m currently working on.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and we are introducing a premium **Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit)** to the Singaporean market. Rather than a standard retail snack, we are positioning this as a high-margin, versatile "pairing" element for F&B channels—specifically bars, cafes, and hotels. 

With the massive K-food trend in Singapore, we’ve developed localized pairing concepts like the "K-Biscuit & Kaya Jam" or as a complementary side for craft cocktails. Given your experience in demand planning for major consumer brands, I’d love to get your thoughts on how this type of niche, trend-driven product fits into the current F&B landscape.

Would you be open to a brief chat or a quick exchange of ideas on this?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
