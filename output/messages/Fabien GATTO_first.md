Hi Fabien,

I’ve been following your work on value chain transformation and operational excellence within the FMCG (Grande consommation) sector. Your focus on driving efficiency and strategic planning across diverse portfolios is truly impressive.

I'm reaching out because we've identified a unique opportunity in the Singaporean F&B market that aligns with the current K-food trend. We are introducing **Korean Retro Hardtack (K-Biscuit)**—a highly cost-effective and versatile snack optimized for bar and cafe channels.

Given your expertise in supply chain and operations, I thought you might appreciate the operational efficiency and price competitiveness this product offers. It is a premium-quality, export-ready item (ISO certified) that serves as a perfect pairing for coffee or cocktails, allowing F&B operators to enhance their margins while capturing the K-culture wave.

I’d love to share a bit more about our market entry strategy for Singapore if you're open to a brief exchange.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
