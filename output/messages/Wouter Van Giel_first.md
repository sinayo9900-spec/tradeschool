Hi Wouter,

I saw your recent post about the Penfolds wine dinner at Jara—hosting Peter Gago must have been a truly exceptional experience for your guests. It's clear that Capella continues to set a high bar for curated culinary storytelling in Singapore.

I’m reaching out because I’ve been following Capella’s innovative approach to F&B. Given the rising global interest in K-food, I wanted to introduce a unique element that fits the "retro-luxe" trend: our premium Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits). 

While they are a beloved classic in Korea, we’re seeing them gain new life in high-end hospitality as a versatile, light pairing for craft cocktails or artisanal coffee services. They offer a subtle, nostalgic crunch that complements sophisticated beverage programs without overpowering the palate.

I’d love to share how these could add a unique "K-retro" touch to your lounge or bar experience. Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps receiving some samples to explore the pairing possibilities?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
