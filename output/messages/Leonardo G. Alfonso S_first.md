Hi Leonardo,

I noticed your expertise in F&B Distribution and your active involvement in the Singaporean market. With the K-food trend continuing to grow, I thought you might be interested in a unique snack concept that's currently trending in Korea's vibrant bar and cafe scene.

We provide Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a premium, export-ready retro snack. They are particularly popular as a versatile pairing for cocktails and coffee, offering a distinct "K-Retro" aesthetic and excellent price competitiveness for F&B operators.

Given your background in distribution, I believe this could be a high-margin addition to your portfolio that aligns with local consumer interests.

Would you be open to a quick exchange to see if there's a potential fit for your current distribution channels?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
