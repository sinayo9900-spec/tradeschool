Hi Sundaralingam,

I’ve been following the evolving F&B distribution landscape in Singapore and noticed your expertise in the sector. With the current surge in K-food popularity, I thought you might find our latest project interesting.

We are introducing a premium Korean retro snack, the **K-Biscuit (Korean Hardtack)**, which is gaining traction as a versatile, cost-effective pairing for bars, cafes, and hospitality channels. Its unique texture and "K-retro" appeal make it an excellent complement to existing snack lineups, especially for businesses looking to tap into the Korean food trend without high overheads.

Given your background in F&B distribution, I’d love to share how this could add value to your current portfolio. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving some product details?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
