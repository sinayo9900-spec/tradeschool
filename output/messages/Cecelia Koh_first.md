Hi Cecelia,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of Singapore’s F&B scene, particularly the rising interest in unique K-food pairings within the cocktail and cafe culture.

I’m Jiwoo, and I’m currently introducing a premium 'Korean Hardtack' (K-Biscuit) to the Singapore market. It’s a classic retro snack that’s proving to be an exceptionally versatile, high-margin side for F&B channels. Given its strong appeal to the younger demographic and its perfect pairing with coffee or cocktails, I thought it might be a refreshing addition to your current product lineup.

Our product combines the "K-food" premium image with excellent cost-efficiency for bulk procurement. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas to see if this concept aligns with your current goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
