Hi Ravin,

I was really inspired by your recent post about the "For Singapore" celebration events. The way your team at Compass Group reimagined modern hawker canapés while delivering at such a high scale with precision and adaptability is truly impressive.

I’m Jiwoo Shin, and I’ve been following how you’re elevating the F&B and catering experience for corporate clients. I wanted to reach out because we are currently introducing a premium Korean retro snack—the **K-Biscuit (Hardtack)**—specifically tailored for professional F&B and high-profile event channels in Singapore.

Given your flair for blending tradition with modern presentation, I see a great potential fit. These biscuits are incredibly versatile; they serve as a cost-effective, premium-quality base for innovative pairings—such as fusion recipes with local Kaya jam—making them ideal for the "Modern Hawker" style menus your team excels at.

I’d love to share how this export-ready, high-quality snack could complement your upcoming event rotations or F&B menus. Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving some samples to explore this further?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
