Hi Senthil,

I’ve been following your insights on international trade and your active involvement in global trade fairs. Given your expertise in export consultancy and navigating F&B trends, I wanted to reach out regarding a product that is currently seeing high demand in the Southeast Asian market.

We are specializing in the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**, a premium retro-style snack. With the current K-food wave in Singapore, we’ve seen it become a favorite for F&B operators looking for cost-effective yet trendy bar snack pairings—especially for cocktails, coffee, and even local favorites like Kaya jam.

Our products are produced with export-standard quality (ISO certified) and we offer versatile lines including plant-based versions suitable for various dietary requirements. Given your focus on connecting quality brands with international opportunities, I believe this could be a high-potential addition to the portfolios you manage or represent at upcoming exhibitions.

I’d love to send you a brief product deck if you think this aligns with any of your current trade projects.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
