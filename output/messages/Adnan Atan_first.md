Hi Adnan,

I’ve been closely following the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore and noticed how skillfully the market is integrating unique global flavors to meet the growing demand for K-food trends.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a "K-Retro" snack concept that aligns perfectly with the current shift toward versatile, cost-effective side snacks for bars and cafes. Our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) is specifically designed to complement beverage pairings—whether it's cocktails, craft beers, or even local favorites like coffee with Kaya jam. 

Given your expertise in the industry, I thought this could be a high-margin, trendy addition to your current lineup that resonates well with the younger, K-culture-savvy demographic in Singapore. 

Would you be open to a brief exchange or seeing a few pairing concepts we’ve developed for the local market?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
