Hi Alfred,

I recently came across your post about the power of association collaboration and building stronger industry ecosystems. Your point about expanding perspectives and pooling resources to create greater value for members really resonated with me.

Given your leadership at the Hospitality Purchasing Association Singapore and your deep background in F&B supply chains, I thought our latest F&B solution might be of interest. We are introducing the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** to the Singapore market—a highly cost-effective, retro-themed snack that aligns perfectly with the current K-food trend.

It’s designed specifically for high-volume F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels, offering excellent pairing versatility (from cocktails to coffee) while maintaining a competitive edge in procurement costs. 

I’d love to explore how this could add unique value to your network or your current F&B projects. Would you be open to a brief exchange of ideas when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
