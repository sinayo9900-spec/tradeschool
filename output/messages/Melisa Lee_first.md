Hi Melisa,

I’ve been following the dynamic shifts in Singapore’s F&B distribution sector and noticed your work in bringing high-quality products to the local market.

With the current surge in K-food trends across Singapore, I thought our **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** might be a strategic fit for your portfolio. It is a versatile, retro-inspired snack that offers exceptional cost-efficiency, specifically designed for high-volume F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels.

Our product is produced with export-grade professionalism (ISO standards) and has shown great potential for creative pairings—whether it’s served as a complimentary bar snack or paired with local favorites like Kaya jam. It’s a simple way to tap into the "K-experience" that Singaporean consumers are currently craving.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a product brief to see if this aligns with your upcoming procurement needs?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
