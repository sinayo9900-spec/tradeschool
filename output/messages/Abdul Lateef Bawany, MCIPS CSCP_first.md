Hi Abdul Lateef,

I’ve been following your work in F&B distribution and noticed your impressive credentials as an MCIPS and CSCP professional. Given your expertise in supply chain excellence and procurement, I thought you might find our latest K-food initiative particularly relevant to the current market trends in Singapore.

I am Jiwoo Shin, and we are introducing a premium Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) designed specifically for high-volume F&B channels like bars, cafes, and hotels. As K-food continues to gain massive traction among Singaporean consumers, our product offers a unique "retro" appeal combined with exceptional price competitiveness—allowing for high-margin menu pairings with coffee or cocktails.

Knowing your focus on supply chain efficiency, you'll appreciate that our production is optimized for consistent, large-scale export with a focus on cost-effectiveness. 

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this could add strategic value to your current F&B distribution portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
