Hi Josen,

I’ve been following your work in the Singapore F&B sector and was impressed by your focus on innovative sourcing and trending consumer preferences.

With the rising demand for unique K-food experiences in Singapore, I wanted to introduce our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). It’s a versatile, cost-effective snack that pairs exceptionally well with coffee and cocktails, or even with local favorites like Kaya jam—making it an ideal fit for bar and cafe menus looking for something distinct yet profitable.

We specialize in high-volume supply with premium quality standards (ISO certified) and have seen great engagement from younger demographics who love the "K-retro" aesthetic.

I’d love to send over a brief deck on how our K-Biscuit can complement your current snack lineup. Would you be open to a quick look?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
