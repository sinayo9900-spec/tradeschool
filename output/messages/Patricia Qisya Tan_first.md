Hi Patricia,

I hope you had a wonderful and refreshing 12-day Chinese New Year break with your family and husband. It was inspiring to read about your focus on being fully present—certainly a great way to recharge before galloping into the Year of the Horse!

I’m reaching out because I noticed your commitment to "Powering Projects Through Reliable Supply" in Singapore. While our industries differ, I believe there is a unique synergy in how we approach distribution and high-quality partnerships. 

Currently, we are introducing a premium, export-quality "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit) to the Singapore market. It is a cost-effective, retro-inspired snack that perfectly captures the current K-food trend. Given its versatility, it serves as an excellent high-quality pantry staple or a unique corporate gift for project partners who appreciate premium quality and "ISO-certified" standards.

As an entrepreneur experienced in the wholesale space, I thought you might be interested in how this product is being localized for the Singaporean market. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving more information when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
