Hi Steven,

I’ve been closely following the dynamic F&B trends in Singapore and noticed your commitment to delivering high-quality, trendy experiences in the industry.

With the current K-food momentum, I wanted to introduce our premium "Korean Hardtack Biscuits" (K-Biscuits). As an export-specialized product, they offer a unique, cost-effective solution for bar and cafe snack pairings—matching perfectly with craft cocktails or even local favorites like Kaya jam.

I believe these could strategically complement your current product lineup by offering a refreshing "retro-cool" narrative that resonates with the modern consumer. Would you be open to a brief exchange on how these might fit your upcoming procurement needs?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
