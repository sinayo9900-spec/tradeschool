Hi Jiwoo, I see you're distributing Korean food products in Singapore — great to see the K-food momentum building here.

We supply Korean hardtack biscuits (건빵), a classic retro snack that pairs really well with cocktails and coffee. A few F&B spots have started offering them as a unique K-snack bar bite, and the response has been solid.

Thought it might be a natural addition to your current Korean line. Would you be open to a quick chat about it?
