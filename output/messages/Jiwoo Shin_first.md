Hi Jiwoo,

I’ve been following [Company]’s impressive work in bringing quality Korean food lines to Singapore. Given your role as Procurement Manager, I wanted to reach out regarding a unique item that aligns with the current K-food trend.

We specialize in a "Korean Retro Snack" called Hardtack (K-Biscuit). It’s gaining significant traction as a cost-effective, versatile bar snack pairing—perfect for Singapore’s growing cocktail and cafe culture. Since you already manage a successful Korean portfolio, I thought this might be a timely addition to your distribution network.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this fits your current sourcing strategy?

Best regards,

[Your Name]
