Hi Nilay, 

I've been following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B sector, and it’s impressive to see how distribution channels are evolving alongside the rising demand for authentic K-food experiences.

I'm Jiwoo Shin, and I'm currently introducing a unique "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit) that’s gaining traction as a versatile, cost-effective snack for bars, cafes, and hotels. Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I thought this retro-themed snack could be a high-value addition to your portfolio, especially with its excellent pairing potential for the city's vibrant cocktail and coffee scenes.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with your current distribution focus?

Best regards,
Jiwoo Shin
