Hi Simon,

I’ve been following the updates from the Republic of Singapore Yacht Club and recently came across your post regarding the evolving hospitality landscape. Your focus on elevating the member experience and staying ahead of service trends is truly impressive.

Given the current surge of interest in K-food across Singapore’s premium F&B scene, I’m reaching out to see if you’ve considered a "K-Retro" touch for your club's lounge or bar. We specialize in **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a premium, export-quality snack that serves as a unique and highly cost-effective pairing for both craft cocktails and artisanal coffee.

Our biscuits offer a sophisticated yet nostalgic storytelling element that resonates well with the local crowd, and they are specifically designed for high-volume, premium hospitality environments.

Would you be open to exploring how these pairings might complement your current snack lineup at the Yacht Club?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
