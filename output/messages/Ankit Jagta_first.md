Hi Ankit,

I’ve been following Sugar’s role in supporting F&B trade and noticed your focus on maintaining a competitive edge in the Singapore market.

With the ongoing surge of K-food interest, I thought our Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit) might be a great fit for your portfolio. It’s a versatile, cost-competitive retro snack that pairs exceptionally well with coffee, cocktails, and even local favorites like Kaya jam—perfect for the bars and cafes you work with.

We specialize in export-grade snacks with a focus on premium quality and reliable supply chains, ensuring the high standards expected in the Singaporean market. I’d love to see if this could be a valuable addition to your current trade offerings.

Would you be open to a brief chat to explore this further?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
