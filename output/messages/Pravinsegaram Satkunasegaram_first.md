Hi Pravinsegaram,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of Singapore’s F&B scene and noticed your focus on delivering unique experiences to the market.

With the surging popularity of K-food trends in Singapore, I’m currently introducing a classic "Korean Retro Snack" (K-Biscuit) that is gaining traction as a highly cost-effective and versatile pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels. 

Our K-Biscuit offers a premium crunch that complements everything from specialty coffee to craft cocktails, providing a nostalgic yet trendy storytelling element for your customers. I believe it could be a strategic addition to your current lineup to drive engagement without the high overhead of typical premium imports.

Would you be open to a brief chat or seeing a quick concept deck on how this fits the local Singaporean palate?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
