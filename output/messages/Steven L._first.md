Hi Steven,

I’ve been following your work in Singapore's F&B distribution landscape and noticed your focus on bringing high-quality, market-ready products to the local sector.

With the K-food trend continuing to gain significant momentum, I’m reaching out to introduce a premium, export-ready Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit). Produced under strict quality standards, this authentic retro snack offers exceptional versatility for Singapore’s diverse F&B channels—serving as a highly cost-effective bar snack pairing or a unique menu addition for cafes (it pairs surprisingly well with local favorites like Kaya jam).

Given your expertise in the distribution sector, I believe this "K-Retro" concept could offer a distinctive competitive edge to your current portfolio, combining a nostalgic storytelling element with strong commercial value.

Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a product brief to see if this aligns with your upcoming distribution plans?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
