Hi Venus,

I’ve been closely following the evolving F&B landscape in Singapore, particularly how global operations are increasingly integrating unique, high-value products to meet the growing demand for authentic K-food experiences.

Given your expertise in Global Operations, I wanted to introduce a product that bridges the gap between cost-efficiency and the latest "K-Retro" trend: the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**.

As Singapore's cocktail and cafe culture continues to mature, we see a significant opportunity for this versatile snack:
*   **Strategic Cost-Efficiency:** Optimized for high-volume F&B channels like bars, hotels, and cafes.
*   **K-Food Storytelling:** Leverages the popular retro-aesthetic and cultural heritage currently trending among younger Singaporean consumers.
*   **Versatile Pairing:** Complements everything from specialty coffee to craft cocktails, with local adaptation potential (e.g., Kaya jam pairings).

Our export-ready production ensures the premium quality and scalability required for global F&B standards. I’d love to share more about how this could complement your current procurement or operational strategy.

Would you be open to exploring this further when you have a moment?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
