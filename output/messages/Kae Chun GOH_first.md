Hi Kae Chun,

I have been following your expertise in the F&B distribution space and noticed your focus on bringing unique, high-quality flavors to the Singapore market.

With the current K-food trend and the vibrant growth of Singapore's cocktail and cafe scene, our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits) are proving to be a perfect fit as a cost-effective, premium bar snack. They offer a nostalgic "retro" charm that resonates with younger consumers while being versatile enough for creative pairings—whether it's with craft cocktails or local favorites like Kaya jam.

As an export specialist focused on premium quality and ISO standards, I believe our K-Biscuits could be a valuable, high-margin addition to your existing portfolio.

Would you be open to a brief conversation to see if this aligns with your current distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
