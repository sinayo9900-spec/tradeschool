Hi Kunal,

I’ve been following the dynamic growth of Singapore’s F&B landscape, particularly the evolving trends in the premium bar and cafe sectors. It’s impressive to see how the market continues to embrace unique, high-quality international flavors.

I’m reaching out because we are introducing a modern take on a classic Korean retro snack—the K-Biscuit (Korean Hardtack)—specifically curated for F&B channels. With the ongoing K-food trend in Singapore, this product offers a unique storytelling element and exceptional pairing versatility for cocktails, coffee, or even local favorites like Kaya jam.

Our goal is to provide a cost-effective, premium-quality side snack that helps F&B operators differentiate their offerings while tapping into the "K-retro" aesthetic that resonates so strongly with younger demographics.

I thought this might be a refreshing addition to your current lineup. Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving some more information on how this could add value to your business?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
