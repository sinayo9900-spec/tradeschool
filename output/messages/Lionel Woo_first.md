Hi Lionel,

I’ve been following your work in the Singapore F&B distribution space and was impressed by your expertise in identifying products that resonate with local market trends.

With the current surge in K-food popularity across Singapore, I wanted to introduce a high-margin, versatile snack that is currently gaining traction: the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**.

It’s a classic retro snack that offers exceptional cost-competitiveness, making it an ideal "complimentary" or "side" snack for bars, cafes, and hotels. Beyond being a simple biscuit, it pairs beautifully with coffee, cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam, allowing for creative menu expansions.

I believe this could be a great addition to your distribution portfolio to meet the demand for trendy yet affordable K-snacks. 

If you're open to it, I'd love to share a brief product deck or send over some samples for you to review. Would you be interested in exploring this further?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
