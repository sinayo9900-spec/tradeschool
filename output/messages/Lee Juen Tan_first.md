Hi Lee Juen,

Congratulations on your new role as Manager of Ops Planning & Contingency at the Singapore Food Agency! I’ve been following SFA’s initiatives in food resilience, and it’s impressive to see the strategic work being done for Singapore's food ecosystem.

I’m reaching out because we’ve noticed a significant surge in the K-food trend across Singapore’s F&B sector, particularly with versatile, shelf-stable items. We specialize in premium Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a retro snack that is gaining traction as a cost-effective, high-quality pairing for the local bar and cafe scene.

Our products are produced with strict export-grade standards and offer excellent versatility for local F&B operators looking to enhance their menus with authentic K-food elements. I thought our insights into these consumer trends and supply stability might be of interest given your new focus at SFA.

Would you be open to a brief exchange about how these premium Korean snacks are being integrated into Singapore’s evolving F&B landscape?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
