Hi Srinath,

I’ve been following the impressive growth of the F&B distribution scene in Singapore and noticed your expertise in navigating the local market trends.

With the current surge in K-food popularity across Singapore’s bars and cafes, I wanted to reach out regarding a product that bridges the gap between premium K-culture and high-margin side snacks. We specialize in **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**—a classic, retro snack that is gaining new life as a versatile pairing for craft beers, cocktails, and coffee.

Given its exceptional cost-competitiveness and "K-retro" storytelling potential, I believe it could be a strategic addition to your current portfolio, especially for clients looking for unique yet affordable alternatives to standard bar bites.

If you're open to exploring new K-snack options that align with the latest consumer interests, I’d love to share more details on how we can support your distribution channels.

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
