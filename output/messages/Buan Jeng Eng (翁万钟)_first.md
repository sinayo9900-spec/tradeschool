Hi Buan Jeng,

I’ve been closely following the vibrant F&B trends in Singapore, especially the growing appetite for authentic K-food experiences within the local bar and cafe sectors.

Given your expertise in procurement at Indirect category, I wanted to introduce a versatile snack that fits the current market demand perfectly. We provide Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a premium retro snack that serves as an excellent, cost-effective pairing for everything from specialty coffee to craft cocktails.

With the rising popularity of K-culture, these biscuits offer a unique storytelling element and high-margin potential for F&B outlets looking to diversify their side-snack offerings. Our products are manufactured to professional export standards, ensuring the reliability and quality required for the Singaporean market.

Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving some more information on how this could add value to your current sourcing portfolio?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
