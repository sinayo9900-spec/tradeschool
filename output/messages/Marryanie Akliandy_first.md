Hi Marryanie,

I’ve been following the dynamic shifts in the Malaysian F&B market and noticed your leadership in procurement. With the continuous growth of K-food trends and the rising demand for versatile, high-quality side snacks in the hospitality sector, I wanted to introduce a cost-effective solution that aligns with these evolving interests.

We specialize in premium Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)—a retro-themed snack that perfectly complements bar, cafe, and hotel F&B menus. Our products are produced with export-grade quality standards, ensuring they meet the high expectations of professional procurement. We’ve seen great success in pairing these with everything from artisanal coffee to craft cocktails, offering a unique "K-Retro" experience that resonates with modern consumers looking for something both nostalgic and trendy.

I believe our K-Biscuits could provide a competitive edge to your current snack portfolio by offering a high-quality, high-margin alternative that taps into the current K-culture wave.

Would you be open to receiving our digital catalog to see if this fits your upcoming procurement strategy?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
