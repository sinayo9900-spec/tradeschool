Hi Kensha,

I’ve been following the vibrant F&B distribution scene in Singapore and noticed your impressive work in the industry.

Given the soaring interest in K-food among Singaporean consumers, I thought our **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)** might be a perfect addition to your portfolio. It’s a classic, high-margin retro snack that pairs exceptionally well with coffee and cocktails—making it a versatile choice for the local bar and cafe scene.

I’d love to share how this cost-effective snack can complement your current lineup and provide a unique edge in the competitive F&B market.

Would you be open to a brief chat to explore if this could be a good fit for your distribution channels?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
