Hi Pierre,

I noticed your impressive track record in procurement and supply chain excellence within the F&B sector—your MCIPS credentials clearly reflect a deep expertise in strategic sourcing and value creation.

Given the continuous growth of the K-food trend in Singapore, I am reaching out because our latest export-ready snack, the **Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)**, aligns perfectly with the current market demand for versatile, cost-effective F&B solutions.

As a retro-themed snack with high "K-experience" appeal, it offers a unique value proposition for your distribution network:
*   **Cost-Efficiency:** Optimized for bulk supply to bars, cafes, and hotel F&B channels.
*   **Versatile Pairing:** Excellent as a basic bar snack or paired with local favorites like Kaya jam and specialty coffee.
*   **Export Excellence:** Produced under strict quality standards (ISO-ready) to ensure reliability for professional procurement partners.

I believe this product could be a strategic addition to your portfolio, offering both competitive margins and high consumer engagement.

Would you be open to receiving a brief product deck to see if this fits your current distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
