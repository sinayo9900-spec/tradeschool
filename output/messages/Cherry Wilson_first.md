Hi Cherry,

I hope you’re having a productive week. I’ve been closely following the vibrant growth of Singapore’s F&B scene, particularly the evolving cocktail and cafe culture that continues to set trends across the region.

Given the massive popularity of K-food and the growing "retro" aesthetic among younger consumers in Singapore, I wanted to introduce our Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits). As a classic Korean snack, it offers a unique storytelling element and pairs exceptionally well as a complimentary side for coffee or a crunchy accompaniment to craft cocktails.

Our K-Biscuits are produced with premium quality standards and offer excellent cost-competitiveness for bulk F&B supply. I believe this could be a refreshing addition to your current snack lineup, tapping into the K-food trend while maintaining high margins.

Would you be open to a brief chat or perhaps receiving a short introduction deck to see if this fits your current procurement needs?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
