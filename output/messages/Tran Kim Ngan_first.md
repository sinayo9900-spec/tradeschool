Hi Tran Kim Ngan,

I came across your profile and was impressed by your extensive background in purchasing and sourcing. Given your expertise as an import-export executive, I thought you might be interested in the current K-food momentum within Singapore's F&B scene.

We are currently introducing a premium Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)—a cost-effective, retro-style snack that is gaining significant traction. As an export specialist focusing on premium quality, we’ve seen great potential for this product in bar and cafe channels, especially when paired with cocktails or local favorites like Kaya jam.

I’d love to share how this versatile item can add unique value to F&B portfolios. Would you be open to a brief chat or receiving a product brief for your future sourcing projects?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
