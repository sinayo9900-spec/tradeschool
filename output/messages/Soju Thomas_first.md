Hi Soju,

I’ve been following Transmed’s impressive footprint in Singapore’s FMCG sector. Given your extensive experience in export and import, I wanted to reach out regarding a growing trend we're seeing in the local F&B market.

With the rising demand for K-food, we are introducing the "Korean Hardtack Biscuit" (K-Biscuit)—a versatile, cost-effective retro snack that pairs perfectly with Singapore's vibrant bar and cafe culture. It offers a unique storytelling element (Korean retro-cool) while maintaining a very competitive price point compared to premium snacks.

I believe this could be a strategic addition to Transmed’s portfolio to capture the current K-wave interest among younger consumers and F&B operators looking for high-margin snack options.

Would you be open to a brief exchange to see if this aligns with your current distribution goals?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
