Hi Omer,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of the F&B distribution sector in Singapore and noticed your extensive experience in bringing quality products to the market.

With the current K-food trend and the evolving bar culture in Singapore, I wanted to introduce a unique item that's gaining a lot of traction: the "Korean Hardtack Biscuit (K-Biscuit)." It is a premium, retro-style snack that serves as an excellent, cost-effective pairing for bars, cafes, and hotels.

Our product is specifically designed for international export with high-quality standards (ISO certified), offering a perfect balance of heritage and modern appeal. Given your focus on distribution, I believe this could be a highly competitive addition to your current portfolio.

Would you be open to a brief chat to see if this aligns with your upcoming projects?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
