Hi Lauri,

I’ve been following your work in leading high-complexity F&B and resort operations. Your focus on elevating guest experiences while maintaining strong commercial results is truly impressive.

Given the vibrant growth of the K-food trend and cocktail culture in Singapore, I’m reaching out to introduce a versatile product that fits perfectly into premium hospitality settings: **Korean Hardtack Biscuits (K-Biscuits)**.

Our K-Biscuits are a classic retro snack that offers a unique storytelling element and exceptional pairing versatility. Whether served as a complementary side for craft cocktails and coffee or integrated into local dessert recipes like Kaya pairings, they provide a high-quality, cost-effective solution for high-volume bars and lounges.

I’d love to share how this "K-retro" snack could complement your current F&B lineup and enhance the guest experience at your venues. Would you be open to a brief exchange or receiving more details?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
