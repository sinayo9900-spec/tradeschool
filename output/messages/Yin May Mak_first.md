Hi Yin May,

I’ve been following the vibrant growth of the F&B distribution sector in Singapore, particularly how local channels are successfully integrating international food trends.

I’m reaching out because we are currently introducing a premium **Korean Retro Snack (K-Biscuit)** to the Singapore market. Given your expertise in F&B distribution, I believe this could be a strategic addition to your portfolio—especially for bar and cafe channels looking for high-quality, cost-effective pairing options.

Our K-Biscuits have seen great success in Korea as a versatile "K-food" staple, pairing perfectly with coffee, cocktails, or even local favorites like Kaya jam. It’s an ideal time to leverage the current K-food momentum with a product that offers both cultural storytelling and strong price competitiveness.

I would love to share a brief overview of how this could complement your current lineup. Would you be open to a quick chat sometime next week?

Best regards,

Jiwoo Shin
